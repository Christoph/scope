A Los Angeles bungalow that was once the home of Walt Disney is temporarily being saved from demolition.

The Craftsman two-bedroom building in the Los Feliz neighborhood - Disney's first home in the state - was due to be torn down after its current owners applied for a demolition permit.

A Los Angeles bungalow that was once the home of Walt Disney is temporarily being saved from demolition.

The Craftsman two-bedroom building in the Los Feliz neighborhood - Disney's first home in the state - was due to be torn down after its current owners applied for a demolition permit.

But Ken Bernstein, the Office of Historical Resources' manager and principal city planner told ABC that his department had taken action after the request was filed.

The hold is only temporary however and Bernstein is now putting together a more complete application to have the property considered as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

And on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Office of Historical Resources put a 75-day hold on the request.

He explained that he had initiated the hold because the property had already been identified as being 'significant' because of the iconic status of its previous owners.

The hold is only temporary however and Bernstein is now putting together a more complete application to have the property considered as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

Locals have also been fighting for the property to be saved from the scrap heap.

Wilfredo Mercado of Los Feliz told ABC 7: 'I do not think that it should be demolished. I think it's a historical, kind of, cultural thing.'

And Dennis Zanabra said: 'I want to fight it 'til the end ... it's just going to be another 'McMansion.' I don't want that. I don't think anyone wants that.'

His uncle charged just $5 a week for rent, which was often paid by his brother Roy, with whom he later moved with into the Olive Hill Apartments across the street, turning the bungalow into a studio. Pictured Walt and Roy Disney

They would go on to co-found one of the most established movie studios in the world as well as opening the hugely successful Disney theme parks

Disney had rented the home from his uncle in 1923 after arriving in LA from Kansas City according to the Disney Examiner, and stayed there between August and September of that year while he looked for work in Hollywood.

His uncle charged just $5 a week for rent, which was often paid by his brother Roy, with whom he later moved with into the Olive Hill Apartments across the street, turning the bungalow into a studio.

Disney began making cartoon reels for movie theaters in the property.

The brothers also rented a room in an office building nearby to their new apartment to create cartoons, which were to be the building blocks of Disney Bros. Studio, and where they created their early hit, Alice Comedies.

They would go on to co-found one of the most established movie studios in the world as well as opening the hugely successful Disney theme parks.
Seth Rogen has said on a number of occasions that the desire to make his own animated movie came from a love for Pixar movies. Even though he didn’t exactly grow up on them as a child (he was already 14 when the first Toy Story arrived in 1995), he’s still loved them immensely as an adult. However, if Rogen was going to attempt to make his version of a Pixar movie, you know it wasn’t going to be anywhere near family friendly.

Sausage Party had a special screening here at Comic-Con last night, and the final result of years of development, test screenings and hard work is an outrageous comedy that brings the laughs hard, and all the most raunchy and raw hilarity hasn’t even been touched by the movie’s marketing.

Get our full Sausage Party review after the jump.

As the trailers have already perfectly laid out, Sausage Party follows a crew of food friends from a grocery store who couldn’t be more excited to go home with humans. For them, leaving the aisles of the Shopwells supermarket means they’re heading to the “great beyond” by way of the merciful “gods” who take them right out the door. However, when one honey mustard jar (Danny McBride) ends up returning from the great beyond, he comes with wild, worrisome details of a horrifying truth about what actually lies on the other side for food.

However, much of the story focuses on Frank the hot dog (Seth Rogen) and Brenda the hot dog bun (Kristen Wiig) after they get left behind at the store following the desperate act of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride) jumping out of the cart to his death, resulting in a cart collision and several items being thrown from a woman’s cart just before heading home, creating a Saving Private Ryan war zone of death in the grocery aisle.

This is the catalyst for everything that happens in the story because it creates the villain, an angry douche (voiced by Nick Kroll) who is more than angry that he won’t be able to serve his purpose of getting up inside one of the gods, and it sends Frank and Brenda on a journey around the grocery store as Frank tries to determine if there’s any truth to Honey Mustard’s claims, while Brenda is extremely resistant to even thinking about the idea of the gods actually doing horrifying things to the food. Meanwhile, outside of the store, Frank’s hot dog friends try to figure out how to get back to the store.

What’s surprising about Sausage Party is all the commentary on religion, which isn’t something that’s a subtle metaphor for you to parse out between jokes. It’s pretty much in your face the whole way through, but not annoyingly so. It doesn’t offer any groundbreaking approaches or ideas to add to the heated discussion between those who believe in a higher power and those who don’t, but it does show, in a vulgar, ridiculous and funny manner, why the way we handle talking about religion with other people is so frustrating and unnecessary.

Don’t worry, Sausage Party never gets overtly preachy because this thematic element is just used as the driving force for the story. There are still endless food puns (including a great recurring gag that just pisses off the Douche more and more as it happens), plenty of dirty jokes, mostly about the food having sex with each other, and a cavalcade of incredible voice talent that makes the proceedings that much better.

Some of the highlights of supporting characters include a Jewish bagel (Edward Norton) and Middle Eastern lavash (David Krumholtz) constantly at each others’ throats, and a trio of non-perishables voiced by Bill Hader, Craig Robinson and co-director Conrad Vernon. Plenty of the characters end up being racial stereotypes based on their foods, but it’s played up for so many laughs in such a hilarious way with everyone getting mocked.

But easily the funniest and most shocking parts of Sausage Party come in the end, bringing a surprising amount of violence beyond food being eaten, and one of the most dirty, perverted, twisted climaxes you’ve ever seen in an animated movie from a major motion picture studio. Seriously, it’s a miracle that this movie was made by Sony Pictures, and you won’t believe what this movie gets away with, all because the characters are food instead of people. Plus, it sets up the idea for what could be an amazing sequel, but we won’t spoil that here.

Sausage Party doesn’t bring any innovation to filmmaking with its raunchy animation, and sometimes the progression of the story feels a little clunky. But all of the parts that work and hit hard with raucous laughter make up for some of those shortcomings. In the end, Sausage Party is one of the funniest movies of the year, bringing a plethora of jokes that will offend everyone in the best way possible.
Grandson of Manson murder victim speaks out about possible Leslie van Houten parole

Tony LaMontagne says he and his family will fight the release of the woman who fatally stabbed his grandparents, Rosemary and Leno LaBianca.
The odds of a successful jailbreak are never good. On a night in April 2012, they were all but impossible for Chen Guangcheng: one blind Chinese dissident against the 100 guards surrounding his home and village in Shandong province. Political activism against the Chinese government had earned Chen six years of what he called “brutal” detainment—translation: regular beatings—first in prison and later under house arrest. And so, to escape, the 40-year-old Chen waited for a moonless sky, and then scaled the government-built wall around his house, relying on his other senses to guide him across rivers and roads. Three hundred miles later—at one point he was reduced to crawling after breaking bones in his foot—the fugitive reached his sanctuary: the American Embassy in Beijing.

The story of the blind man eluding a domestic-security apparatus with an annual budget of $111 billion “electrified China’s rights activists,” according to The New York Times. The embarrassed country’s Internet police tried to squelch the story by censoring micro-blogs, an information-sharing platform in China similar to the government-banned Twitter.

Twenty years ago this week, The Shawshank Redemption hit multiplexes. It’s a period prison drama with stately, old-fashioned rhythms, starring Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, wrongfully convicted of killing his wife, her lover and serving two life terms, and Morgan Freeman as fellow lifer “Red” Redding, who narrates the film. But the 90s were an era of booyah action movies starring the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. In Shawshank, the story of a decades-long quest for redemption and freedom, the closest things to action sequences involve fighting off buggery or defiantly blasting a Mozart duettino. Reviews were mostly favorable, but the film bombed, failing to earn even $1 million on its opening weekend and eventually eking out $16 million (about $25 million today) at the American box office during its initial release, not nearly enough—and even less so after marketing costs and exhibitors’ cuts—to recoup its $25 million budget.

That was then. Today The Shawshank Redemption tops the IMDb’s Top 250 cinema-favorites list with more than a million votes, having passed the previous champ, The Godfather, in 2008. (While The Godfather—trailing by 300,000 votes—has maintained its runner-up position, Citizen Kane, the perennial greatest movie ever in critics’ polls, whispers “Rosebud” from No. 66.) Readers of the British movie magazine Empire voted The Shawshank Redemption* No. 4 in a 2008 list of “the 500 Greatest Films of All Time,” and in 2011 the film won a BBC Radio favorite-film poll.

Morgan Freeman relies on less empirical evidence. “About everywhere you go, people say, ‘The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw,’ ” he told me. “Just comes out of them.” Not that he’s a disinterested observer, but Tim Robbins backs his co-star: “I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, there are people who say, ‘That movie changed my life.’ ” Even the world’s most famous former prisoner connected with the movie, according to Robbins: “When I met [Nelson Mandela], he talked about loving Shawshank.”

How did a period prison film running 142 minutes—a life sentence for most audiences—become a global phenomenon capable of rankling a world superpower and stirring a Nobel Peace Prize winner? To borrow a quote from Shawshank, “Geology is the study of pressure and time. That’s all it takes, really. Pressure and time.”

Writer-director Frank Darabont now owns a Spanish villa in Los Angeles’s Los Feliz district—Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie also call the neighborhood home—which serves solely as his bustling production office. But in the 1980s, before his Oscar nominations and his stints as creator and executive producer of the AMC series The Walking Dead and the TNT series Mob City, Darabont was just another broke Hollywood hanger-on imagining his name on the back of a director’s chair. “I had no career whatsoever. I was nailing sets together on low-budget films to keep body and soul together,” he says. But Darabont, a “rabid and devoted” Stephen King fan, nursed a chimera: turning one of the writer’s stories into a film.

Not many novelists have seen their work sail past as many movie-studio gatekeepers as King, starting with 1976’s blood-soaked hit Carrie. The author famously hated director Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation of his novel The Shining—King felt actor Shelley Duvall’s Wendy was “one of the most misogynistic characters ever put on film”—but he didn’t punish other filmmakers. Instead, King maintains a policy of granting newbie directors in need of a calling card the rights to his short stories for one dollar. In 1983 a 20-something Darabont handed King a buck to make The Woman in the Room, one of the few amateur short films based on his work that the author enjoyed. But Darabont’s real obsession was a prison yarn, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, from Different Seasons, a collection of four novellas that represented King’s attempt to break out of the genre corner he’d written himself into over the years. With his ultimate goal a feature film, Darabont waited for his résumé to lengthen enough to support his aspirations before approaching King again. “In 1987, my first produced screenplay credit was A Nightmare on Elm Street 3,” says Darabont. “And I thought, Perhaps now is the time.”

Once Darabont received King’s blessing, he set about adapting Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The 96-page story is anything but cinematic, consisting largely of Red ruminating about fellow prisoner Andy, confounding Hollywood’s predilection for high-concept “Harry Potter meets Die Hard” loglines. Even King “didn’t really understand how you make a movie out of it,” says Darabont. “To me it was just dead obvious.” Still, Darabont says he “wasn’t ready” to sit down at his word processor right away, and five years passed, as he focused on paid jobs writing scripts for The Blob and The Fly II.

Darabont, who “wanted to honor the source material,” mimicked the novella’s narrative thrust in his screenplay and even lifted some dialogue verbatim. Other plot points were entirely his invention, sharpening the film’s themes and adding dashes of cinematic violence. In King’s story, a minor character, Brooks, dies uneventfully in an old folks’ home. The movie dedicates a poignant montage to the now more pivotal Brooks’s inability to make it on the outside and his subsequent heart-wrenching suicide by hanging. Tommy, a young con who can clear Andy’s name, trades his silence for a transfer to a minimum-security prison in King’s version. The script has Tommy “chewed to pieces by gunfire.” And Darabont condensed King’s several wardens into the corrupt Warden Norton, who eventually blows his brains out rather than pay Lady Justice for his sins.

Alfred Hitchcock reportedly said some version of “To make a great film you need three things: the script, the script, and the script.” Robbins says of Darabont’s finished adaptation, “It was the best script I’ve ever read. Ever.” Freeman repeated a variation of that accolade—if not the best script, certainly among the top.

Completed in an eight-week writing jag, Darabont’s script had the good fortune to land on the desk of a filmmaker with “a prison obsession”—longtime Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer. “I like reading about prison for some reason,” she says. “Any script that came in that was a prison movie, [my co-workers] would say, ‘Oh, Liz’ll read it.’ ”

Prison films date back to Hollywood’s earliest days, and the genre includes such landmarks as The Big House, Cool Hand Luke, Papillon, Escape from Alcatraz, and Bad Boys. But prison films have never been on the list of reliable moneymakers, which made Glotzer’s threat to quit if Castle Rock didn’t make Shawshank all the more nervy, but her passion had been stirred by her emotional response to Darabont’s script, becoming so engrossed in it she “didn’t want to finish reading.” Echoing Robbins and Freeman, she says, “It was the best script I’d ever read when I read it.”

Luckily for her, director Rob Reiner—a founder and “godfather of the company,” according to Darabont—“flipped” for the script. Reiner then made the screenwriter an offer almost no one would refuse: a rumored $3 million to direct Shawshank himself.

The figure was “something like that,” says Darabont, before pausing to “set the record straight . . . I’ve read so much speculation through the years, and now with the Internet every asshole who doesn’t know crap knows everything. I’ve heard versions of this where there was some power struggle over the script and the truth is incredibly simple.”

Reiner had himself mined Different Seasons and struck a vein when he turned the novella The Body into 1986’s Oscar-nominated Stand by Me. By the 90s, Castle Rock—formed after Stand by Me’s success and named for the movie’s fictional town—had a string of hit one-sheets on its office walls, from When Harry Met Sally, to another Reiner adaptation of yet another King story, Misery. Coming off the success of 1992’s A Few Good Men, Reiner saw that film’s star, Tom Cruise, as Shawshank’s Andy Dufresne. Though Darabont was attached to direct his script, Castle Rock asked if he would consider this alternative: “A shitload of dough,” according to Darabont, in exchange for allowing Reiner to make the movie with Cruise.

Darabont, who had been born in a French refugee camp for Hungarians fleeing the 1956 revolution and subsequently grew up poor in L.A., was tempted. “In my struggling-writer days, I could barely meet the rent,” he says. The Shawshank payday, whatever its precise number, would have put Darabont at the top of a profession he’d been “trying to achieve membership in for a lot of years.” Glotzer confirms Darabont was “completely tormented” by the offer. As if to turn the screws, Castle Rock said it would finance any other movie he wanted to direct if he ceded to Reiner. Surprisingly, though Darabont was only 33, philosophical thinking won out because, he says, “you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do.” Still, the decision to direct the film himself was “nerve-racking. People get fucked in this business all the time. Contractually, [Castle Rock] could fire me after the first meeting, say I wasn’t hacking it, and, oh, gee, we’re just going to bring in Rob Reiner.”

True to his reputation as “a mensch,” however, Reiner acted as Darabont’s mentor instead—though, according to Glotzer, one detail needled the older director: “Rob joked, ‘[Different Seasons] is on my desk for years. You would have thought we’d have read the next story! But we didn’t.” Says Reiner, “I find it interesting that two of the most talked-about film adaptations of Stephen King’s work [Stand by Me and The Shawshank Redemption] came from the same collection of novellas and don’t rely on classic horror or supernatural elements of storytelling. In an odd way, they unmask Stephen King as a writer of exquisitely observed characters and brilliant dialog.” (In 1998, a third novella became director Bryan Singer’s Apt Pupil. Blumhouse Productions, the company behind Paranormal Activity and Insidious, optioned The Breathing Method, the remaining novella, in 2012.)

With the director in place, casting calls went out. The narrator of King’s story is a white Irishman, hence the nickname Red. “My brain went to some of my all-time favorite actors like Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall,” says Darabont. “For one reason or another they weren’t available.” Producer Glotzer ignored the racial casting specs and suggested Morgan Freeman for the role.

Interviewing Freeman is like speaking with a favorite uncle who also happens to be God. With a melodic voice that’s calm and authoritative, Freeman has commanded aural attention since his stint in the 1970s as The Electric Company’s Easy Reader on PBS, where he sang, “I groove on all the words around,” in bell-bottoms. Shawshank was “an absolutely delightful script,” says Freeman. “So I called my agent and said, ‘It doesn’t matter which part it is—I want to be in it.’ He said, ‘Well, I think they want you to do Red.’ And I thought, Wow, I control the movie! I was flabbergasted by that.”

Offers went out to the 1990s’ usual suspects for the part of Andy Dufresne. Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner passed. And though Cruise loved the screenplay—even doing a table read with the filmmakers—he balked at taking direction from a green director. Cruise considered signing on if Reiner agreed to keep a watchful eye on the production. “And Rob said, ‘No, if you’re going to do it with [Darabont], it’s his vision,’ ” says Glotzer. “So then Tom Cruise didn’t want to do it.”

Freeman insists that he suggested Robbins, and Darabont defers to his recollection: “If Morgan says that he mentioned Tim, I’m perfectly willing to take him at his word.”

Unlike some movie stars who are shockingly diminutive, at six feet five inches, actor and director Tim Robbins holds one of the Oscars’ more obscure records: tallest winner (as supporting actor in 2003’s Mystic River). He cruises to our interview on a bicycle and talks passionately about hedge-funders crowding out Manhattan’s artists. Like his character Andy, Robbins’s “We the people” persona inspires an impulse to buck the status quo, even though we’re meeting in an upscale-hotel lobby in Santa Monica.

By the early 90s, Robbins had broken out of minor roles in The Love Boat and Top Gun. His ascent to stardom began when he was cast as the lunkhead pitcher “Nuke” LaLoosh in 1988’s Bull Durham. When he won best actor at 1992’s Cannes Film Festival for his role in The Player as a deliciously sleazy Hollywood studio executive, Newsweek named Robbins the “man of the moment.”

Robbins used his A-list status to insist that Darabont’s inexperience—he’d directed only one made-for-TV movie, Buried Alive—be counterbalanced by a seasoned cinematographer, Roger Deakins, whom Robbins had worked with the year before on the Coen brothers’ film The Hudsucker Proxy. (Deakins would go on to shoot the death-row drama Dead Man Walking, which Robbins directed.) The cast was rounded out by Bob Gunton, then primarily a stage and TV actor, as the sanctimonious Warden Norton; Clancy Brown (who had played a delinquent opposite Sean Penn in Bad Boys) as the sadistic Captain Hadley; and veteran character actor James Whitmore as beloved elderly convict Brooks Hatlen. James Gandolfini passed on playing Bogs, a prison rapist, for a role in True Romance that entailed sucker-punching Patricia Arquette. Brad Pitt, cast in the role of Tommy, dropped out after his brief but shirtless appearance in Thelma & Louise initiated his rise to leading man.

Filming on location is often something to be endured, and Shawshank’s schedule was particularly brutal: workdays were 15 to 18 hours, six days a week, over three humid months inside the former Ohio State Reformatory, in Mansfield, and on nearby constructed sets, which included the huge cellblock. “We were lucky to have Sundays off,” says Darabont.

A bakery in Mansfield now sells Bundt-cake replicas of the Gothic prison, which these days is a tourist attraction that draws Shawshank pilgrims. But in 1993 the defunct penitentiary—closed three years earlier for inhumane living conditions—“was a very bleak place,” according to Darabont. Robbins adds, “You could feel the pain. It was the pain of thousands of people.” The production employed former inmates who shared personal stories similar to those in Shawshank’s script, “in terms of the violence of the guards and throwing people off the top of cellblocks,” says Deakins.

Robbins remembers “going to that place inside for three months. It was never depressing, because Andy had this hope inside. But it was, at times, dark because of the situations that the character goes through.” Deakins confirms that working on the film was “a very intense situation. Sometimes the performances really affected me while I was shooting it.” The scene that gave Deakins “a tingle down the spine” is also Robbins’s favorite: the prisoners drinking beer on the sunny license-plate-factory roof. Coming more than a half an hour into the movie—and two years into Andy’s sentence—it’s the first bright spot in a film heretofore gray in palette and tone. Andy risks being thrown off the roof by Captain Hadley in order to procure a few “suds” for his fellow prisoners—a moment when the character shifts from victim to burgeoning legend. That Andy himself doesn’t drink is beside the point.

The scene was shot over a “hard, hard day,” says Freeman. “We were actually tarring that roof. And tar doesn’t stay hot and viscous long. It tends to dry and harden, so you’re really working. For the different setups you had to keep doing it over and over and over and over and over.”

Darabont recalls the scene as a complicated “technical thing,” because he had to match a camera move very precisely to some narration that Freeman had pre-recorded, requiring take after take. “Then I remember we got a nice take. I turned around, and somebody behind me had tears rolling down their face, and I thought, O.K., good, that one worked.’ ” By the end of the sequence “we were exhausted,” says Freeman. When the cast finally got to “sit down and drink that beer, it was very welcome.”

Robbins merely flashes his famously inscrutable smile when asked about tensions on the set of Shawshank, though he does allow that any “difficult times . . . had to do with the length of the days.” Freeman, like his character, Red, has no problem rounding out the narrative. “Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those,” says Freeman. Most “bad moments” stemmed from Darabont’s asking for repeated takes. “The answer [I’d give him] was no,” says Freeman. “I don’t want to be chewing the scenery. Acting itself isn’t difficult. But having to do something again and again for no discernible reason tends to be a bit debilitating to the energy.” Freeman recalls a scene where the guards re-trace Andy’s escape route, retching when they discover themselves sitting in raw sewage. “My character was listening and laughing, just howling with laughter. I had to shoot that too many times.”

Darabont puts a diplomatic spin on his feature-film debut: “I learned a lot. A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs.”

Darabont likens the stress of principal photography to “being beaten with sticks” as the constant artistic compromise makes “every day of filming feel like a failure.” But in the editing room “you start to forget all those self-torturing thoughts.” The first edit of a film that ran nearly two and a half hours in its trimmest form was “long,” says Glotzer. Among the scenes eventually left on the cutting-room floor was one of Red adjusting unevenly to his release during the Summer of Love, when, as his voiceover proclaims, there’s “not a brassiere to be seen.” One scene the producer insisted on keeping was her idea in the first place: Red and Andy’s post-prison reunion on a beach in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. Darabont’s original story ended like King’s—ambiguously—with Red on a bus hoping to get to Mexico. Darabont thought Glotzer’s ending was the “commercial, sappy version,” she says. Yet Glotzer was “adamant. If what you intend is that they’re going to get together, why not give the audience the pleasure of seeing them?”

A leisurely paced prison film with literary inflection didn’t exactly scream blockbuster. Yet Shawshank tested through the roof, according to Glotzer. “I mean, they were the best screenings ever.” Critics were mostly in agreement. Gene Siskel named it “one of the year’s best films” and compared it to One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest, though the long-serving Los Angeles critic Kenneth Turan captured a persistent minority objection to the movie’s “sentimentality,” likening the picture to “a big glob of cotton candy.”

When the movie opened on September 23, 1994, expectations were high. Hollywood tradition dictates filmmakers drive from theater to theater on opening night, ostensibly to stand in the back of packed houses to witness audiences laughing and crying at all the carefully constructed moments. Glotzer recalls that she and Darabont “went to the Cinerama Dome, which was the coolest theater,” where the film was playing. Located on Sunset Boulevard, the 1960s-built movie house has more than 900 seats, but “no one was there”—which Glotzer blames on the “bad L.A. Times review.” The desperate filmmakers cornered two girls outside and “actually sold tickets” on the premise that if the pair didn’t like Shawshank they could call Castle Rock on Monday for a refund. “That was our big opening night,” Glotzer says dryly.

Freeman blames the title for the film’s initial flameout. “Nobody could say, ‘Shawshank Redemption.’ What sells anything is word of mouth. Now, your friends say, ‘Ah, man, I saw this movie, The . . . what was it? Shank, Sham, Shim? Something like that. Anyways, terrific.’ Well, that doesn’t sell you.”

Even if moviegoers could remember the title, 1994 was the year of two other films on opposite sides of the naughty-nice spectrum: Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. Both films became instant cultural phenomena—quoted, parodied, and ultimately devouring box-office receipts worldwide, while “The Shimshunk Reduction,” as Freeman started calling it, continued to play to mostly empty houses.

But in early 1995, Shawshank got its first shot at redemption when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film in seven categories, including best picture, best actor (Freeman), and best adapted screenplay. An awards-season re-release added a bit more money to the coffers. The film was snubbed on Oscar night, a big evening for Forrest Gump, but the award buzz gave Shawshank a second life when it was released on VHS shortly after the Oscars. It would become the top-renting title that year. That turn of events “surprised me most,” says Deakins. “Go figure.”

In the early 90s, the cable-television pioneer Ted Turner was hungry for “quality entertainment product,” as he once put it, to feed his new TNT network. He already owned MGM’s pre-1948 film library. Yet Turner couldn’t rely on dated talkies to bring in new audiences, so in 1993 he bought Castle Rock to expand his repertory. With production and distribution now under one roof, TNT was able to leapfrog the networks—which normally got first dibs on broadcast rights to new movies—and acquired the rights to Shawshank, Turner in essence selling the film to himself.

Memories are faulty 20 years on, especially when it comes to recalling precise figures, and the box containing the financial records for Shawshank has gone missing on a studio lot. Many accounts have suggested that Turner sold himself the rights for “much lower than normal for such a big film,” as the Shawshank trivia page on IMDb puts it. Darabont remembers it this way: “Turner, bless his heart, part of his deal for those movies that got funded during his ownership [of Castle Rock] was that he got to air them as much as he wanted.” A more likely scenario, in Glotzer’s view, starts with the cost of a film’s licensing fee generally being based on its box-office receipts; Shawshank’s dismal $28 million gross would have translated into a bargain basement fee while TNT could still charge a premium for commercial time. However the economic stars aligned, TNT first aired the movie in June 1997 to top basic-cable ratings, and then began showing it over and over . . . and over. “Yeah, someone said, ‘On any given day, turn on the TV and see The Shawshank Redemption,’ ” says Freeman.

And it was through television that the real alchemy between Shawshank and its audience began. The film’s popularity “wasn’t a weed growing,” says Freeman. “It was kind of an oak tree or something—you know, slow growth.”

A chick flick The Shawshank Redemption is not. There are only two actresses in the film—not counting screen-siren posters of Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, and Raquel Welch—speaking 23 words of dialogue (eight of which are repetitions of “Oh God” in a sex scene). Rather, Shawshank falls under the rubric of “guy cry” movies. Though Deakins’s nuanced cinematography is lost on the small screen, watching Shawshank on TV allows a man to shed a few cathartic tears—usually during the montage where Brooks hangs himself—while ensconced on his Barcalounger in the privacy of his home. (A typical Tweet on the subject comes from @chrisk69: “A man is allowed to cry like a little girl once a year, and as Shawshank Redemption is on the TV tonight my time has come. #Brooks­was­here.”) Many home viewers embraced the film’s sentiment and emotion—qualities some critics took Shawshank to the woodshed for—and were moved by the film’s theme of undying hope as expressed through Red and Andy’s undying bond.

At heart, the film is that rare beast: a relationship movie for men. As Robbins puts it, “Here was a movie about the friendship of two men without a car chase in it.” Freeman goes one step further, saying, “To me it was a love affair. It was two men who really loved each other.” Andy and Red’s on-screen relationship, nurtured over decades, mirrors the intimate connection viewers gradually built with the film over the same time frame. Eventually coming upon Shawshank while flipping channels had a hypnotic effect for many: there was Freeman’s omnipresent honeypot voice luring audiences to entertainment comfort food like a siren. Steven Spielberg has called it his “chewing-gum movie,” says Darabont. “In other words, you’ve stepped in it and can’t get it off your foot. You have to watch the rest of the movie.” Perhaps this is because, as Anthony Lane wrote in an October 1994 New Yorker Film File, despite “moments of hokey togetherness, and way too much voice-over . . . the picture stays on track and leaves you, appropriately enough, with a surging sense of release.”

It’s a Wonderful Life and The Wizard of Oz—the most viewed film of all time, according to the Library of Congress—followed similarly erratic paths into America’s psyche. Both were box-office disappointments that were defibrillated by TV reruns. And like The Wizard of Oz’s “There’s no place like home,” Shawshank quotes are now part of the beloved-dialogue lexicon. “It’s always, ‘Get busy living or get busy dying,’ ” says Freeman. “That must be the one that resonates the most. You know, are you going to do something about your life or not?” That mantra alone has inspired everything from T-shirts and tattoos to pop songs and sermons.

The dénouement of The Shawshank Redemption sees Andy crawling through what Red’s narration describes as a “river of shit”—the jail’s plumbing pipe—after 20 years of maniacally chipping away at his cement cell wall with a tiny hammer. When the sewer spills Andy out into a creek, he rips his shirt off, raises his hands to the falling rain, and revels in his glorious moment of freedom. And, yes, lightning strikes for good measure. It’s that kind of movie. How Chen Guangcheng celebrated his arrival at the American Embassy in Beijing is unknown. Reuters did report the fate of He Peirong, a woman who assisted Chen in his escape: officers took her for questioning to a hotel room where The Shawshank Redemption just happened to be showing on TV. And as improbable as it sounds, detainee and police “sat together on the bed to watch” the film.

Variety called Shawshank “a rough diamond” when it opened, and so the film responded to pressure (repeated viewings) and time (two decades) to ultimately become, if not a cinematic jewel, a global Rorschach test. “I believe part of the reason the movie is so important to people is . . . that in a way it works as a whole for whatever your life is,” says Robbins. “That no matter what your prison is—whether it’s a job that you hate, a bad relationship that you’re slogging through, whether your warden is a terrible boss or a wife or a husband—it holds out the possibility that there is freedom inside you. And that, at some point in life, there is a warm spot on a beach and that we can all get there. But sometimes it takes a while.”

IMDb’s blue-ribbon panel consists of registered, movie-loving voters, and the site even provides a math equation—Weighted Rating = (v + (v+m)) × R + (m ÷ (v+m)) × C—for how the rankings are determined. (IMDb gives some votes more “weight” to eliminate “vote stuffing.” To protect the integrity of its list against math-whiz saboteurs, IMDb does not “disclose the exact methods used” to determine that weight.
Hours after Survivor co-founder Frankie Sullivan chastised Mike Huckabee for an unauthorized use of the band's "Eye of the Tiger" at a campaign rally, R.E.M. issued a public rebuke against politicians who use their music without permission.

Related Trump Seriously: On the Trail With the GOP's Tough Guy Rolling Stone goes on the trail with GOP tough guy Donald Trump and finds a serious candidate in it for the long haul.

"Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you — you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men," R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe said (via bassist Mike Mills' Twitter page). "Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign."

The statement was in response to Donald Trump using one of the group's songs at a Washington, D.C. rally Wednesday afternoon. Trump and fellow presidential nominee Ted Cruz appeared together at the rally to lambast President Obama and the recent nuclear deal with Iran alongside Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck. During his intro, Trump came out to R.E.M.'s 1987 hit "It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)," presumably to reinforce his thoughts on the effects of the Iran deal.

After the rally, Mills took to Twitter to write, "Personally, I think the Orange Clown will do anything for attention. I hate giving it to him." He added, "The R.E.M. statement will be regarding Trump's use of our song. Nothing more than that!"

Shortly after, the band issued a statement condemning the use of their music at political events, but asking fans to look at the "bigger picture."

"While we do not authorize or condone the use of our music at this political event, and do ask that these candidates cease and desist from doing so, let us remember that there are things of greater importance at stake here," the band wrote. "The media and the American voter should focus on the bigger picture, and not allow grandstanding politicians to distract us from the pressing issues of the day and of the current Presidential campaign."

A spokesperson for Trump was not immediately available for comment.

This isn't Trump's first controversy with musicians this year. In June, the Rolling Stone cover star used Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World" to kick off his presidential campaign, sparking condemnation from the musician.

"Donald Trump was not authorized to use 'Rockin' in the Free World' in his presidential candidacy announcement," a spokesperson for the rocker's Lookout Management said at the time. "Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America." The Trump campaign agreed to stop using Young's music in the future. It is unclear if the campaign will continue to use R.E.M.'s music.

CHINO, Calif. (AP) — A California panel recommended parole Thursday for former Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten more than four decades after she went to prison for the notorious killings of a wealthy grocer and his wife.

The decision will now undergo administrative review by the Board of Parole Hearings. If upheld it goes to Gov. Jerry Brown, who has the final word on whether the now-66-year-old Van Houten is released from the California Institution for Women in Chino.

Brown previously blocked the parole of former Manson follower Bruce Davis, citing the gravity of his offenses and his refusal to fully accept responsibility for his role in the murders of a stunt man and a musician.

Van Houten was “numb” after the parole board decision was made at the California Institution for Women, said her attorney Rich Pfeiffer.

Van Houten, a one-time homecoming princess, participated in the killings of Leno La Bianca and his wife Rosemary a day after other so-called “Manson family” members murdered pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others in 1969.

The killings were the start of what Manson believed was a coming race war. He dubbed it “Helter Skelter” after a Beatles song.

Van Houten was the youngest Manson follower to take part in one of the nation’s most notorious killings after she descended into a life of drugs and joined Manson’s cult in the 1960s.

Since then, she has completed college degrees and been commended for her behavior as a model prisoner.

Earlier Thursday, she described in graphic detail how she helped secure a pillow over the head of Rosemary La Bianca with a lamp cord and hold her down while someone else stabbed the woman in her home in 1969.

Van Houten recounted the killing during her 21st parole hearing at the California Institution for Women, saying she had looked off into the distance until another Manson follower told her to do something and she joined in the stabbing.

“I don’t let myself off the hook. I don’t find parts in any of this that makes me feel the slightest bit good about myself,” she told the parole board panel.

The La Biancas were stabbed numerous times and the word “WAR” was carved on the stomach of Leno La Bianca.

Van Houten’s lawyer, Rich Pfeiffer, said in an earlier interview that she presents no danger to the public and should be freed.

“The only violent thing she has ever done in her entire life was this crime and that was under the control of Charles Manson,” he said. “She is just not a public safety risk, and when you are not a public safety risk, the law says you shall be released.”

The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office declined to comment ahead of Thursday’s hearing.

Sharon Tate’s sister, Debra, has started an online petition opposing parole for Van Houten, saying she failed to show remorse for years after the crimes and can’t be trusted.

At her last hearing in 2013, a parole commissioner told Van Houten she had failed to explain how someone as intelligent and well-bred as she could have committed such cruel and atrocious crimes.

Van Houten told the panel she had been traumatized by her parents’ divorce when she was 14, her pregnancy soon after and her mother’s insistence she have an abortion. During the hearing, she apologized to everyone she had harmed.

Van Houten did not participate in the Tate killings but went along the next night when the La Biancas were slain. She was 19 at the time.

Her defense lawyers portrayed her as a young woman from a good family who had been a homecoming princess and showed promise until she got involved with drugs and was recruited into Manson’s cult.

During the penalty phase of her trial, she confessed to joining in stabbing Rosemary La Bianca after she was dead.

Van Houten’s conviction was overturned on appeal. She was retried twice and convicted in 1978 of two counts of murder and conspiracy.

Manson, 81, and other followers involved in the killings are still jailed.

Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles “Tex” Watson have each been denied parole multiple times, while fellow defendant Susan Atkins died in prison in 2009.

Davis was approved for parole but Brown blocked his release in 2014. Davis was not involved in the Tate-La Bianca murders.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Charles Milles Manson (born Charles Milles Maddox, November 12, 1934)[2]:136–7 is an American criminal who led what became known as the Manson Family, a quasi-commune that arose in the California desert in the late 1960s. Manson and his followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations over a period of five weeks in the summer of 1969. In 1971 he was found guilty of conspiracy to commit the murders of seven people — most notably of the actress Sharon Tate — all of which were carried out by members of the group at his instruction. He is currently serving nine concurrent life sentences at Corcoran State Prison in Corcoran, California.

Manson believed in what he called "Helter Skelter", a term he took from the Beatles' song of the same name. Manson believed Helter Skelter to be an impending apocalyptic race war, which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the Beatles' song. He believed the murders would help precipitate that war. From the beginning of his notoriety, a pop culture arose around him in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity, violence and the macabre.

At the time the Family began to form, Manson was an unemployed former convict, who had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for a variety of offenses. Before the murders, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson, drummer and co-founder of the Beach Boys. After Manson was charged with the crimes of which he was later convicted, recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially. Various musicians have covered some of his songs.

Early life [ edit ]

Childhood [ edit ]

Born to an unmarried 16-year-old named Kathleen Maddox (1918–1973),[3] in the General Hospital, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Manson was first named "no name Maddox".[2]:136–7[4][5] Within weeks, he was called Charles Milles Maddox.[2]:136–7[6][7] For a period after his birth, his mother was married to a laborer named William Manson (1910–?),[7] whose last name the boy was given. His biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Scott (May 11, 1910 – December 30, 1954)[8] against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a paternity suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in 1937. Possibly, Charles Manson never knew his biological father.[2]:136–7[5]

Several statements in Manson's 1953 case file from the seven months he would later spend at the National Training School for Boys in Washington, D.C., allude to the possibility that "Colonel Scott" was black.[2]:555 These include the first two sentences of his family background section, which read: "Father: unknown. He is alleged to have been a colored cook by the name of Scott, with whom Charles's mother had been promiscuous at the time of pregnancy."[2]:556 When asked about these official records by attorney Vincent Bugliosi in 1971, Manson emphatically denied that his biological father had black ancestry.[2]:588 In addition, the 1920 and 1930 census list Colonel Scott and his father as white.

In the biography Manson in His Own Words, Colonel Scott is said to have been "a young drugstore cowboy ... a transient laborer working on a nearby dam project." It is not clear what "nearby" means. The description is in a paragraph that indicates Kathleen Maddox gave birth to Manson "while living in Cincinnati", after she had run away from her own home, in Ashland, Kentucky.[9]

There is much about Manson's early life that is in dispute because of the varying stories he has offered to interviewers, many of which were untrue. Manson's mother was allegedly a heavy drinker.[2]:136–7 According to Manson, she once sold her son for a pitcher of beer to a childless waitress, from whom his uncle retrieved him some days later.[10]

When Manson's mother and her brother were sentenced to five years' imprisonment for robbing a Charleston, West Virginia, service station in 1939 by brandishing a ketchup bottle, Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia.[11] Upon her 1942 parole, Manson's mother retrieved her son and lived with him in a series of run-down hotel rooms.[2]:136–7 Manson himself later characterized her physical embrace of him on the day she returned from prison as his sole happy childhood memory.[10] In 1947, Kathleen Maddox tried to have her son placed in a foster home but failed because no such home was available. The court placed Manson in Gibault School for Boys in Terre Haute, Indiana. After 10 months, he fled from there to his mother, who rejected him.[2]:136–7

First offenses [ edit ]

By burglarizing a liquor store, Manson obtained money that enabled him to rent a room.[2]:136–7 He committed a string of burglaries of other stores, including one from which he stole a bicycle, but was eventually caught in the act and sent to an Indianapolis juvenile center. He escaped after one day, but was recaptured and placed in Boys Town. Four days after his arrival there, he escaped with another boy. The pair committed two armed robberies on their way to the home of the other boy's uncle.[2]:137–146

Caught during the second of two subsequent break-ins of grocery stores, Manson was sent, at age 13, to the Indiana Boys School, where, he would later claim, he was brutalized sexually and otherwise.[10] After many failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in 1951.[2]:137–146

In Utah, the three were caught driving to California in cars they had stolen. They had robbed several filling stations along the way. For the federal crime of taking a stolen car across a state line, Manson was sent to Washington, D.C.'s National Training School for Boys. Despite four years of schooling and an I.Q. of 109 (later tested at age 21),[2]:137–146 he was illiterate. A caseworker deemed him aggressively antisocial.[2]:137–146

First imprisonment [ edit ]

In October 1951, on a psychiatrist's recommendation, Manson was transferred to Natural Bridge Honor Camp, a minimum security institution. Less than a month before a scheduled February 1952 parole hearing, one of the boys there "took a razor blade and held it against another boy's throat while Manson sodomized him."[2]:137–146[10] Manson was transferred to the Federal Reformatory, Petersburg, Virginia, where he was considered "dangerous."[2]:137–146 In September 1952, a number of other serious disciplinary offenses resulted in his transfer to the Federal Reformatory at Chillicothe, Ohio, a more secure institution.[2]:137–146 About a month after the transfer, he became almost a model resident. Good work habits and a rise in his educational level from the lower fourth to the upper seventh grade won him a May 1954 parole.[2]:137–146

After temporarily honoring a parole condition that he live with his aunt and uncle in West Virginia, Manson moved in with his mother in that same state. In January 1955, he married a hospital waitress named Rosalie Jean Willis, with whom, by his own account, he found genuine, if short-lived, marital happiness.[10] He supported their marriage via small-time jobs and auto theft.[2]:137–146

Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in Los Angeles in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' probation. His subsequent failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in Florida resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis. His probation was revoked; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at Terminal Island, San Pedro, California.[2]:137–146

While Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son, Charles Manson, Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was subsequently given five years probation, and his parole was denied.[2]:137–146

Second imprisonment [ edit ]

Manson received five years' parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged U.S. Treasury check. He received a 10-year suspended sentence and probation after a young woman with an arrest record for prostitution made a "tearful plea" before the court that she and Manson were "deeply in love ... and would marry if Charlie were freed."[2]:137–146 Before the year's end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so testimony against him would not be required of her.[2]:137–146

The woman's name was Leona; as a prostitute, she had used the name Candy Stevens. After Manson took her and another woman from California to New Mexico for purposes of prostitution, he was held and questioned for violation of the Mann Act. Though he was released, he evidently suspected, rightly, that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared, in violation of his probation, a bench warrant was issued; an April 1960 indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed.[2]:137–146 Arrested in Laredo, Texas, in June, when one of the women was arrested for prostitution, Manson was returned to Los Angeles. For violation of his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his 10-year sentence.[2]:137–146

In July 1961, after a year spent unsuccessfully appealing the revocation of his probation, Manson was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island. There, he took guitar lessons from Barker-Karpis gang leader Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, and obtained a contact name of someone at Universal Studios in Hollywood from another inmate, Phil Kaufman.[12] According to Jeff Guinn's 2013 biography of Manson, Charlie's mother Kathleen moved from California to Washington state to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration, working nearby as a waitress.[13]

Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. His September 1961 annual review noted he had a "tremendous drive to call attention to himself", an observation echoed in September 1964.[2]:137–146 In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce, in the pursuit of which she alleged that she and Manson had had a son, Charles Luther.[2]:137–146

In June 1966, Manson was sent, for the second time in his life, to Terminal Island, in preparation for early release. By March 21, 1967, his release day, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken a number of federal laws; then as now, federal sentences are much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses.[2]:137–146 Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay,[2]:137–146 a fact touched on in a 1981 television interview with Tom Snyder.[14]

1968–69: Manson Family crimes [ edit ]

1971–present: third imprisonment [ edit ]

1980s–90s [ edit ]

The Folsom State Prison , one of the facilities where Manson has been held

In the 1980s, Manson gave four notable interviews. The first, recorded at California Medical Facility and aired June 13, 1981, was by Tom Snyder for NBC's The Tomorrow Show. The second, recorded at San Quentin Prison and aired March 7, 1986, was by Charlie Rose for CBS News Nightwatch; it won the national news Emmy Award for "Best Interview" in 1987.[15] The third, with Geraldo Rivera in 1988, was part of that journalist's prime-time special on Satanism.[16] At least as early as the Snyder interview, Manson's forehead bore a swastika, in the spot where the X carved during his trial had been.[17]

In 1989, Nikolas Schreck conducted an interview of Manson, cutting the interview up for material in his documentary Charles Manson Superstar. Schreck concluded that Manson was not insane, but merely acting that way out of frustration.[18][19]

On September 25, 1984, while imprisoned at the California Medical Facility at Vacaville, Manson was severely burned by a fellow inmate who poured paint thinner on him and set him alight. The other prisoner, Jan Holmstrom, explained that Manson had objected to his Hare Krishna chants and had verbally threatened him. Despite suffering second- and third-degree burns on over 20 percent of his body, Manson recovered from his injuries.[2]:497

In June 1997, Manson was found to have been trafficking in drugs by a prison disciplinary committee.[20] That August, he was moved from Corcoran State Prison to Pelican Bay State Prison.[20]

In a 1998–99 interview in Seconds magazine, Bobby Beausoleil rejected the view that Manson ordered him to kill Gary Hinman.[21] He stated Manson did come to Hinman's house and slash Hinman with a sword. In a 1981 interview with Oui magazine, he denied this. Beausoleil stated that when he read about the Tate murders in the newspaper, "I wasn't even sure at that point – really, I had no idea who had done it until Manson's group were actually arrested for it. It had only crossed my mind and I had a premonition, perhaps. There was some little tickle in my mind that the killings might be connected with them ..." In the Oui magazine interview, he had stated, "When [the Tate-LaBianca murders] happened, I knew who had done it. I was fairly certain."[22]

2000s–10s [ edit ]

On September 5, 2007, MSNBC aired The Mind of Manson, a complete version of a 1987 interview at California's San Quentin State Prison. The footage of the "unshackled, unapologetic, and unruly" Manson had been considered "so unbelievable" that only seven minutes of it had originally been broadcast on The Today Show, for which it had been recorded.[23]

In a January 2008 segment of the Discovery Channel's Most Evil, Barbara Hoyt said that the impression that she had accompanied Ruth Ann Moorehouse to Hawaii just to avoid testifying at Manson's trial was erroneous. Hoyt said she had cooperated with the Family because she was "trying to keep them from killing my family." She stated that, at the time of the trial, she was "constantly being threatened: 'Your family's gonna die. [The murders] could be repeated at your house.'"[24]

On March 15, 2008, the Associated Press reported that forensic investigators had conducted a search for human remains at Barker Ranch the previous month. Following up on longstanding rumors that the Family had killed hitchhikers and runaways who had come into its orbit during its time at Barker, the investigators identified "two likely clandestine grave sites ... and one additional site that merits further investigation."[25] Though they recommended digging, CNN reported on March 28 that the Inyo County sheriff, who questioned the methods they employed with search dogs, had ordered additional tests before any excavation.[26] On 9 May, after a delay caused by damage to test equipment,[27] the sheriff announced that test results had been inconclusive and that "exploratory excavation" would begin on 20 May.[28] In the meantime, Tex Watson had commented publicly that "no one was killed" at the desert camp during the month-and-a-half he was there, after the Tate-LaBianca murders.[29][30] On 21 May, after two days of work, the sheriff brought the search to an end; four potential gravesites had been dug up and had been found to hold no human remains.[31][32] In March 2009, a photograph taken of a 74-year-old Manson, showing a receding hairline, grizzled gray beard and hair and the swastika tattoo still prominent on his forehead, was released to the public by California corrections officials.[33]

Manson at age 74 in March 2009

In November 2009, a Los Angeles DJ and songwriter named Matthew Roberts released correspondence and other evidence indicating he may have been biologically fathered by Manson. Roberts' biological mother claims to have been a member of the Manson Family who left in the summer of 1967 after being raped by Manson; she returned to her parents' home to complete the pregnancy, gave birth on March 22, 1968, and subsequently put Roberts up for adoption. Manson himself has stated that he "could" be the father, acknowledging the biological mother and a sexual relationship with her during 1967; this was nearly two years before the Family began its murderous phase.[34][35]

In 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that Manson was caught with a cell phone in 2009, and had contacted people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia. A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections stated that it was not known if Manson had used the phone for criminal purposes.[36]

Manson at age 76 in June 2011

On October 4, 2012, Bruce Davis, who had been convicted of the murder of Shorty Shea and the attempted robbery by Manson Family members of a Hawthorne gun shop in 1971, was recommended for parole by the California Department of Corrections at his 27th parole hearing. In 2010, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had reversed the board's previous finding in favor of Davis, denying him parole for two more years.[37] On March 1, 2013, and again on August 8, 2014, Governor Jerry Brown also denied parole for Davis.[38]

On November 17, 2014, it was announced that Manson was engaged to 26-year-old Afton Elaine "Star" Burton while still in prison, and had obtained a marriage license on November 7.[39] Burton had been visiting Manson in prison for at least nine years, and maintained several websites that claimed his innocence.[40] The wedding license expired on February 5, 2015, without a marriage ceremony taking place.[41] It was later reported that, according to journalist Daniel Simone, the wedding was cancelled after it was discovered that Burton only wanted to marry Manson so she and a friend Craig "Gray Wolf" Hammond could use his corpse as a tourist attraction after he dies.[41][42] According to Simone, Manson believes he will never die, and may just be using the possibility of marriage as a way to encourage Burton and Hammond to continue visiting him and bringing him gifts.[41] Together with a co-author Heidi Jordan Ley and with the assistance of some of Manson's fellow prisoners, Simone has written a book about Manson and is seeking a publisher for it.[41] Burton said on her web site that the reason the marriage did not take place is merely logistical – that Manson is suffering from an infection and has been in a prison medical facility for two months, and cannot receive visitors.[41] She said she still hoped the marriage license will be renewed and the marriage will take place.[41]

Parole hearings [ edit ]

A footnote to the conclusion of California v. Anderson, the 1972 decision that neutralized California's death sentences, stated, "[A]ny prisoner now under a sentence of death … may file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death."[43]

This made Manson eligible to apply for parole after seven years' incarceration.[2]:488 His first parole hearing took place on November 16, 1978, at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville.[2]:498[44]

Manson was denied parole for the 12th time on April 11, 2012. Manson did not attend the hearing where prison officials argued that Manson had a history of controlling behavior and mental health issues including schizophrenia and paranoid delusional disorder[45] and was too great a danger to be released.[46] It was determined that Manson would not be reconsidered for parole for another 15 years,[47] at which time he would be 92 years old.[48]

His California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation inmate number at Corcoran State Prison is B33920.[49][50]

On March 6, 1970, the day the court vacated Manson's status as his own attorney,[2]:258–269 LIE, an album of Manson music, was released.[51][52][53] This included "Cease to Exist", a Manson composition the Beach Boys had recorded with modified lyrics and the title "Never Learn Not to Love".[54][55] Over the next couple of months, only about 300 of the album's 2,000 copies sold.[56]

Since that time, there have been several releases of Manson recordings—both musical and spoken.[57] The Family Jams includes two compact discs of Manson's songs recorded by the Family in 1970, after Manson and the others had been arrested. Guitar and lead vocals are supplied by Steve Grogan;[2]:125–127 additional vocals are supplied by Lynette Fromme, Sandra Good, Catherine Share, and others.[57][58] One Mind, an album of music, poetry, and spoken word, new at the time of its release, in April 2005,[57] was put out under a Creative Commons license.[59][60]

American rock band Guns N' Roses recorded Manson's "Look at Your Game, Girl", included as an unlisted 13th track on their 1993 album "The Spaghetti Incident?"[2]:488–491[61][62] "My Monkey", which appears on Portrait of an American Family by Marilyn Manson (no relation, as is explained below), includes the lyrics "I had a little monkey / I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread / Along came a choo-choo / Knocked my monkey cuckoo / And now my monkey's dead."[63] These lyrics are from Manson's "Mechanical Man",[64] which is heard on LIE. Crispin Glover covered "Never Say 'Never' To Always" on his album The Big Problem ≠ The Solution. The Solution = Let It Be released in 1989. Transgressive punk rock performance artist GG Allin covered "Garbage Dump" (from LIE) on his album You Give Love A Bad Name.

Several of Manson's songs, including "I'm Scratching Peace Symbols on Your Tombstone" (a.k.a. "First They Made Me Sleep in the Closet"), "Garbage Dump", and "I Can't Remember When", are featured in the soundtrack of the 1976 TV-movie Helter Skelter, where they are performed by Steve Railsback, who portrays Manson.[65]

According to a popular urban legend, Manson unsuccessfully auditioned for the Monkees in late 1965; this is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time.[66]

Cultural reverberation [ edit ]

Beginning in January 1970, Manson was embraced by the underground newspapers Los Angeles Free Press and Tuesday's Child, with the latter proclaiming him "Man of the Year".[67] In June 1970, he was the subject of a Rolling Stone cover story, "Charles Manson: The Incredible Story of the Most Dangerous Man Alive".[67] When a Rolling Stone writer visited the Los Angeles District Attorney's office in preparing that story,[68] he was shocked by a photograph of the bloody "Helter [sic] Skelter" that would bind Manson to popular culture.[69]

Bernardine Dohrn, a leader of the Weather Underground reportedly said about the Tate murders: "Dig it, first they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then they even shoved a fork into a victim's stomach. Wild!".[70]

Manson has been a presence in fashion,[71][72] graphics,[73][74] music,[75] and movies, as well as on television and the stage. In an afterword composed for the 1994 edition of the non-fiction book Helter Skelter, prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi quoted a BBC employee's assertion that a "neo-Manson cult" existing then in Europe was represented by, among other things, approximately 70 rock bands playing songs by Manson and "songs in support of him".[2]:488–491

Manson has even influenced the names of musical performers such as Kasabian, Spahn Ranch, and Marilyn Manson, the last a stage name assembled from "Charles Manson" and "Marilyn Monroe".[76] The story of the Family's activities inspired John Moran's opera The Manson Family and Stephen Sondheim's musical Assassins, the latter of which has Lynette Fromme as a character.[77][78] The tale has been the subject of several movies such as the 1984 film Manson Family Movies,[79] including two television dramatizations of Helter Skelter.[80][81] In the South Park episode "Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson", Manson is a comical character whose inmate number is 06660, an apparent reference to 666, the Biblical "number of the beast".[82][83]

The 2002 novel The Dead Circus by John Kaye includes the activities of the Manson Family as a major plot point.[84]

In 2015, NBC premiered the crime drama Aquarius, with Gethin Anthony playing Manson. The series was set in 1967 and included storylines inspired by actual events involving Manson.[85]

The news was announced Friday at the show's Comic-Con panel in San Diego, where producers also confirmed the drama would end with season five.

Rihanna is checking into A&E's Bates Motel.

Shortly after confirming that season five of the drama would be its last, producers announced Friday at Comic-Con that the pop icon has been tapped to take on an iconic role on the Psycho prequel series.

Rihanna will take on the highly anticipated role of Marion Crane — the iconic character played by Janet Leigh in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. As a refresher: Marion checked into the Bates Motel but never checked out after Norman — dressed as his mother, Norma — stabbed her to death in the shower. Watch Rihanna's announcement below.

"We wanted to thrust the iconic role into a contemporary spotlight and redefine it in a meaningful and exciting new way. We also heard Rihanna was a fan of the show, and we were huge fans of hers, so it was the perfect collision of creativity and fate," executive producers Carlton Cuse and Kerry Ehrin said in a statement released after the Comic-Con announcement.

Season four of the Psycho prequel series ended with Vera Farmiga's Norma Bates being killed off after son Norman (Freddie Highmore) — in his "Mother" persona — filled their house with carbon monoxide.

"Season five is about the ways in which our show does and more specifically does not intersect with the events of Psycho," showrunner Carlton Cuse told THR after the season finale. "We are going to see a version of Norman that is much closer now to the one in the movie, but the way in which he acts and the events in the story will not be the same as the movie. They will cross paths with some of the events in the movie and lead to an ultimate resolution. What that resolution is and how that plays out is something that will be not disconnected to the movie Psycho but will be very much our own story in the same way the entire series has been."

For Rihanna, meanwhile, Bates marks her biggest scripted acting role to date. The casting comes after the singer revealed that she was a big fan of the A&E series in a Vanity Fair cover story. Cuse — and the show's official Twitter account — both took note and came to the Grammy winner with the offer. She's repped by WME.

Other news from the panel included Farmiga's return to the series for its fifth and final season as Norma and as an executive producer. Co-star Max Thieriot will make his directorial debut and Nestor Carbonell will helm the series for a third time. Highmore will also write his second episode alongside Cuse and Ehrin. The final season will go into production in the fall and return in 2017.

Miami (CNN) Tim Kaine took the stage alongside Hillary Clinton in Miami Saturday and offered his first greeting to voters as a vice presidential nominee -- in Spanish.

"Bienvenidos a todos," the Virginia senator said, a phrase that translates to "welcome to everyone."

Clinton and Kaine's first joint appearance as running mates at a campaign rally here marked the official unveiling of the Democratic ticket. The duo will face off against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.

Right off the bat, the contrast that the Clinton campaign will seek to highlight between Kaine and the Republican ticket during the general election was clear.

Speaking at Florida International University, a campus that is more than half Hispanic, Kaine described his vision for an inclusive country. Dipping in and out in Spanish several times, he drew on his experiences as mayor, governor and the time he spent helping Jesuit missionaries in Honduras to emphasize the importance of service.

"I've always believed that however you serve, what matters is whether you actually deliver results for people," Kaine said. "That's been my goal in every position I've ever held."

Kaine sheepishly acknowledged that he may not be a household name, saying: "This might be the first time you've heard my name."

But unlike the famous real estate mogul on the other side of the political aisle, Kaine argued, his heart was in the right place.

"Do you want a trash-talking president or a bridge-building president? Donald Trump trash-talks folks with disabilities. Trash-talks Mexican-Americans and Latinos," Kaine said. "With Donald Trump, it's me first!"

Then, riffing with the crowd, he added: "You're right, he doesn't trash-talk everybody -- he likes Vladimir Putin."

Clinton introduced Kaine as someone who has shown a "lifelong commitment to social justice."

"Sen. Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not," Clinton said. "He is qualified to step into this job and lead on Day 1. And he is a progressive who likes to get things done."

Her introduction of Kaine was in stark contrast to Trump's first event with Pence last weekend. Trump took the stage by himself and spoke at length before turning to the topic of his new running mate. Trump and Pence, who did not know each other prior to this election, also lacked the warmth and admiration that was evident between Clinton and Kaine on stage in Miami on Saturday.

She heralded her pick as a man of faith, willing to work across the aisle and committed to furthering the progressive cause.

"In both of our families, faith wasn't just something we talked about at church on Sundays, it was a call to serve others in every way that we can," she said.

As he looked on from a stool behind Clinton, Kaine lived up to his reputation of "Mr. Nice Guy," grinning and waving to the crowd, and clearly reveling in the moment.

But Clinton warned the crowd: "Make no mistake, behind that smile, Tim also has a backbone of steel."

Pivoting to an issue that holds personal significance for Kaine, Clinton continued: "Just ask the (National Rifle Association). Over and over again he has had the courage to stand up to the gun lobby in their own backyard."

During his tenure as governor, Virginia grappled with the 2007 Virignia Tech massacre -- the country's biggest mass shooting up until that point. Fellow Virginians to this day praise the way Kaine handled the tragedy -- an episode that they say demonstrated both compassion and governing skills.

Trump offered his thoughts on Kaine via Twitter, saying: "Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!"

He later added, "Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!"

Friends and colleagues describe Kaine as steady and even-handed, often using the word "decent" to describe his character.

Politically, Democrats expect Kaine could help Clinton rally voters in the important swing state of Virginia, and that his fluency in Spanish will be a big asset as he campaigns in minority-heavy areas of the country.

Rick Ely, a Miami resident attending the event, said he believed Clinton had made a "safe choice."

"I would have preferred to see her choose Elizabeth Warren -- a more progressive agenda that way. But I certainly understand with Virginia being a swing state, the fact that he speaks fluent Spanish, is helpful," said Ely, 58.

Clinton announced her pick Friday night in a message to her supporters, ending weeks of speculation just days ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia that's set to kick off on Monday.

But even as Clinton and her campaign methodically vetted a number of potential running mates, it was clear that Kaine was on the fast track.

Both Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, are personally fond of Kaine and believed he would be a loyal and dependable governing partner.

Aides say as Clinton deliberated over a shortlist of potentials vice presidential nominees, she continued to return to her "unshakable confidence" in his readiness for the job, as well as her personal comfort with him.

During the vetting process, Clinton was advised by her campaign chairman, John Podesta: "It needs to be someone who, whenever they walk into a room, you are glad to see them, and want to have them as part of any conversation."

Ultimately, it was Kaine that best fit that description.

Anita Goldfeld, 76, said she drove from Boca Raton to see Clinton and Kaine's first event together. Goldfeld supported Bernie Sanders during the primaries but is enthusiastically supporting Clinton -- and now Kaine -- in the general election.

"I think that he is a man who knows, who's had a lot of experience, who would be an excellent asset to Hillary," Goldfeld said.

On the criticism that Kaine is a white, male and ashe himself has put it, "boring," Goldfeld responded: "I'll take boring and knowledgeable -- I'll take a decent human being over someone like Donald Trump."
Another week, another eruption of abuse on Twitter. This time, it was Breitbart writer and self-anointed “supervillain of the Internet” Milo Yiannopoulos, whom the company finally banned after he stoked his followers into flooding Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones with hateful and racist messages. Yiannopoulos went so far as to tweet out fake screenshots of things Jones supposedly but did not actually say on Twitter. In the end, Jones said she would leave Twitter altogether:

I leave Twitter tonight with tears and a very sad heart.All this cause I did a movie.You can hate the movie but the shit I got today…wrong — Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) July 19, 2016

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was apparently aware of the situation, tweeting at Jones as early as Monday evening. But Twitter still took another day to finally kick Yiannopolous off the platform after facing considerable public pressure. On Thursday afternoon, Jones posted a short tweet saying she was grateful for the public’s support. “People should be able to express diverse opinions and beliefs on Twitter,” Twitter said in a statement addressing the incident. “But no one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others.”

Well, fine. That was certainly the right thing for Twitter to do, and as no shortage of incidents show, dealing with online abuse effectively can be tricky. But after years of Twitter maturing as a community and a company, including a seemingly robust anti-abuse policy, what gives? Why didn’t Twitter take more decisive—and frankly, faster—action?

Yes, Twitter walks a fine line in balancing its identity as an open network for all views while at the same time reserving the right to police content so that a mob can’t overpower and harass a single user. And in a lot of ways, it’s made progress: it explicitly banned revenge porn last year. It routinely works with groups to refine its anti-abuse tools, and it hasn’t shied away from banning other high-profile users in the past, including pop star Azealia Banks and right-wing troll Chuck C. Johnson. But some say Twitter is running out of excuses in its failure to fully address this problem. And that’s a shame, because there’s no other network that has accrued quite the same cultural currency as Twitter.

Twitter’s Abuse Problem

The abuse problem is hardly new for Twitter. Seemingly every week, there’s news of yet another prominent user quitting the social network after facing harassment at the hands of a mob.

In some ways, despite being a decade old, Twitter may still be figuring out how to deal with these incidents as they arise. “This is a constant tension between Twitter’s different uses, and people having different standards, and having to do constant line-drawing, whatever your policy is,” says James Grimmelmann, a professor of law who studies social networks and online communities at Cornell University. “With a service the size of Twitter, you’re going to have lots and lots of people pushing at the line.” At the same time, Twitter has made a stronger commitment to free speech than other established social networks.

‘You can be large-scale and safe. But you have to invest in doing that.’ Anil Dash

And in a way that makes Twitter a rare holdout among its rivals. “Twitter is one of the few platforms that is still trying to do old-fashioned-style Internet community, with pseudonyms, and this idea that anybody can connect to anybody,” says technologist and entrepreneur Anil Dash. “Twitter is having problems most other sites don’t because the other sites don’t work like the Internet used to.”

Those sites—Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, in particular—curb the kinds of abuse endemic to open networks by enforcing a more closed culture that limits interactions to other users you’ve already approved. And in closing themselves off, those platforms lose the ability for a kind of live movement to get started and gain traction. Black Lives Matter, for example, flourished on Twitter first and foremost, not Facebook. “Openness has a lot of social value,” Dash says.

Still, Dash doesn’t believe abuse has to be the price of openness. “You can absolutely do both. You can be large-scale and safe,” Dash says. “But you have to invest in doing that.”

Cultural Relevance

It’s tempting to say that a failure to invest in more effective ways to curb abuse is at the heart of Twitter’s problems, and that the failure stems from Twitter’s struggles as a business. Since its founding in 2006, Twitter has gained 310 million monthly active users. But analysts say fewer than 140 million of them interact with the service daily. That’s a meager percentage compared to Facebook (more than a billion daily users) and possibly fewer than much younger rival Snapchat, which according to a recent report, just surpassed Twitter in daily users. Meanwhile, Twitter’s stock price has been meandering downwards for the past year. The pressure to add users and keep them is high.

“A lot of people would say, ‘Of course they’re going to be reluctant and suspend accounts, if their whole issue is they’re not having enough growth,'” Dash says. But he suspects that’s not what’s going on here.

Twitter is a constellation of stars who have outsized influence.

Twitter’s cultural relevance has a value that transcends its raw user numbers, Dash says. Just look at how the Presidential election is playing out on the social network. The problem is rather that Twitter’s seeming commitment to egalitarianism distorts how the site really works. Twitter doesn’t operate like a voting booth—one person, one vote. It’s a constellation of stars who have outsized influence and who garner outsized attention compared to most everyday users. And having that high profile turns those stars—as Dash knows from personal experience—into targets. Where a site like, say, YouTube openly acknowledges and cultivates its creators, leaving would-be abusers with just the comments section to vent their feelings, Twitter in its very structure creates a flawed kind of level playing field. “That privileges the abusers and harassers in seeming like they are peers to creators,” says Dash.

Much more than just giving power users a blue “verified” checkmark, Twitter needs to elevate them and invest in better tools to help likely targets deal with the inevitable abuse they’ll face, he says—better than the ones they have now. At the same time, it needs to be more transparent about how it addresses abuse across the board, since banning users in response only to high-profile incidents involving celebrities suggests exactly the wrong kind of favoritism. What about the abuse suffered by those who don’t have millions of followers that doesn’t make the news?

“If this big area of mistrust really mattered to the company, then they would say, ‘We’re going to fix it and this is the timetable in which were going to do it. And if we don’t, someone’s going to get fired,'” Dash says.

And for Twitter’s sake, that timetable better be narrow. Otherwise, Jones isn’t likely to be the last high-profile user threatening to quit. In a way, her being driven off the platform feels like a decisive moment for the company. Will other stars follow? That’s an exodus Twitter really doesn’t want. Once it begins, the time to fix its abuse problem may have already passed.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is exploiting a rocky day for the Democratic National Committee to reach out to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ supporters who feel their candidate didn’t get a fair shake in the primaries.

On Friday, just days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 emails that suggest DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other party leaders preferred presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over Sanders — despite repeated claims of impartiality.

The following morning, Trump used the controversy as a way to extend an olive branch to Sanders’ supporters, who are far more liberal but generally agree that the political process is rigged to support establishment candidates.

Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2016

The DNC emails contain embarrassing exchanges in which DNC top brass mock Sanders’ campaign, think up anti-Sanders narratives, and apparently consider using Sanders’ religious beliefs to minimize his support. (Though raised Jewish, Sanders is not particularly interested in organized religion.)

For many of Sanders’ supporters, the emails confirmed what they had been saying all along: that the national party had treated Sanders unfairly and viewed his upstart campaign as a threat from the beginning. On Saturday morning, #DNCleak was trending on social media with more than 300,000 tweets.

Trump made a similar appeal to stalwart Sanders fans on Thursday while accepting the GOP’s presidential nomination at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.

“I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders — he never had a chance,” he said. “But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade.”

Trump also cited Sanders’ past criticism of Clinton’s judgment while arguing that the world is less safe after her stint as secretary of state under President Obama.

“Her bad instincts and her bad judgment — something pointed out by Bernie Sanders — are what caused the disasters unfolding today,” he said.

And the WikiLeaks revelation was not the only news to disturb the already uneasy peace between Sanders’ fans and the DNC ahead of next week’s convention.

Clinton announced that she had chosen Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a relatively centrist Democrat, for her running mate in a text message to supporters Friday night.

“I’m thrilled to tell you this first: I’ve chosen Sen. Tim Kaine as my running mate. Welcome him to our team,” she wrote.

Kaine is from a swing state and has a wealth of foreign policy experience, but he definitely does not come from the leftist, Sanders’ wing of the Democratic Party. Kaine supported trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fiercely criticized by Sanders, and the Virginia senator has expressed a personal opposition to abortion.

Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore was among those who bemoaned the Kaine pick. He said Trump picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to fire up the conservative base whereas Clinton’s pick played it safe.

The success of Bernie Sanders’s insurgency is a marvel and an achievement.

His showing is a mark of the anger and frustration felt by so many Americans over the abuses of capitalism that led to the crash of 2008. With the help of millions of voters, especially the young, he has broadened a political debate long hemmed in by the dominance of conservative assumptions and the stifling of progressive aspirations.

Sanders has put a progressive alternative to Obamacare (a single-payer system) back on the political agenda. He has offered a sweeping plan to provide free public college education for all Americans and spoken indefatigably about the corrupting influence of money on our political system.

After hearing an endless stream of preposterous attacks on President Obama as a socialist, we now know what the real thing looks like. And many more Americans now realize that the words “democratic socialism” refer to popular movements in rather attractive places (Denmark, Norway, Sweden) and not to the old Soviet Union.

But there is another reality about Sanders’s effort. He has lost the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton. He was defeated not through trickery or manipulation but in the democratic way: by voters casting ballots.

Before Tuesday’s primaries in Kentucky and Oregon, Clinton had secured about 12.5 million votes to Sanders’s 9.4 million, a healthy majority. Among elected delegates, Clinton led, 1,716 to 1,433, according to the Associated Press count. Add in the preferences of superdelegates, officeholders and party officials who get seats at the national convention, and Clinton had 2,240 delegates, 143 short of the 2,383 she requires.

In apparently winning Kentucky while losing Oregon in Tuesday’s primaries, she pulled to within fewer than 100 delegates of the majority she needs. The Democrats’ system of rewarding delegates proportionally means that — as a matter of pure math and because there are so few contests left — Sanders cannot prevail.

Sanders has certainly earned the right to compete to the last primary, as Clinton did against Barack Obama in 2008. But it is time for Sanders and his supporters to recognize that they share with Clinton and her backers the imperative of preventing Donald Trump from becoming the next president of the United States. Sanders would violate everything he stands for if he did anything to ease Trump’s election.

And a certain bitterness is setting in on the Democratic side that really could be damaging, exemplified by the angry fracas at the Nevada state Democratic convention on Saturday. The over-the-top reaction of Sanders’s supporters over a couple of delegates who won’t affect the outcome speaks to the urgency of peacemaking.

The questions for Sanders and Clinton should not be what his terms of surrender are or what “concessions” Clinton ought to make. To cast matters this way implies a zero-sum game and a cold peace. What they need to find, to use the venerable labor movement term, is solidarity.

Sanders has already pushed Democrats (and the entire national dialogue) in a more progressive direction. He wants to lead an enduring movement that will continue the battle against privilege and inequality. His hopes for turning his troops into a formidable long-term electoral force will face their first test in the battle against Trump.

And Clinton needs what Sanders has to offer. He has made his campaign about something larger than himself. She hasn’t done this yet. She can start by turning the Democratic platform into a fighting document, which is what Sanders has always hoped it would be.

The core policy differences between Clinton and Sanders relate less to goals than to the speed and means through which they’re achieved. Both favor universal access to health insurance, both want to make higher education far more affordable, and both want a big increase in the minimum wage. But in all these areas, Clinton advocates step-by-step approaches and questions the practicality of some of Sanders’s initiatives.

Their meeting point should be around a concept offered by Michael Harrington, the legendary American socialist: “visionary gradualism.” It’s not a slogan but a steady approach to lasting reform that takes into account the urgency of undertaking change, the difficulties of achieving it and the disciplines that democracy imposes.

Sanders wants the party to have a more ambitious vision. This is exactly what Clinton must show voters she has. For both of them, coming together should reflect their shared commitment to taking the country in a direction very different from the one that leads to Trump’s walls, intolerance, authoritarianism and policy-free sorcery.

Justin Zhen was in his WeWork office in midtown Manhattan on July 19 when he published the blog post that would result in his startup, Thinknum, being removed from the co-working space three days later.

The post, “Deep Dive into WeWork’s User Base as Hundreds of Members Cancel,” was an analysis that suggested customers of the trendy rental office-space company are increasingly canceling their memberships. The post also noted that the community events and “meaningful connections, both business and personal” that WeWork advertises to members “have not been well received.”

“WeWork’s all-important churn rate (number of cancellations divided by number of total members) historically has been around 1.2% on an annualized basis,” Zhen, a co-founder of Thinknum, wrote. “This churn rate has increased five times to over 6% in recent months.”

WeWork responded to Zhen with a cease-and-desist letter demanding that he remove the blog post from online publishing platform Medium and delete all the WeWork data that his fledging financial analysis company had collected. The letter stated that Thinknum had violated the terms of its WeWork membership, which forbid “scraping, spidering, crawling” or using “other technology or software” to access WeWork data, according to a copy viewed by Quartz.

Zhen told Reuters on July 21 that he did not believe Thinknum had violated the terms of membership because the team collected data using WeWork’s application programming interface, or API. But at 10:30am today (July 22), WeWork informed Thinknum via email that its membership had been terminated, “effective immediately.” Zhen told Quartz his firm was given 30 minutes to vacate the workspace.

WeWork is the world’s ninth-richest startup, valued at $16 billion. It runs a network of co-working offices in 23 cities spread across seven countries and is also building out a new line of co-living spaces, branded as “WeLive.” WeWork outfits its offices with Silicon Valley-esque amenities such as arcade games and beer-on-tap, selling the promise that work can be at once productive, social, and fun. Its co-founder, Adam Neumann, attempting to describe what makes WeWork special, has called it “a feeling.”

But that valuation—like that of many other so-called unicorns—has recently come into question. Last week, Bloomberg reported that WeWork had in late April slashed its 2016 profit forecast by 78% and its revenue estimate by 14%. Bloomberg said the lower revenue projection was the result of building openings that had been delayed, at times for more than six months.

WeWork said in response to the Bloomberg story that the April document “does not reflect our robust operating momentum.” It also said the April document had been stolen and late last week sued an ex-employee, Joanna Strange, for the alleged theft.

As for Thinknum, it packed up with plans to decamp for another co-working space, potentially one without the social aspects of a WeWork property.

Thinknum co-founder Greg Ugwi said the firm stands by the numbers in its blog post and “did not violate” WeWork’s terms.

“My view is that it touches a nerve,” Ugwi says. “A lot of private unicorns they are determined to control the narrative … It’s people who get extremely vigilant about maintaining one glossy story, so anything that contradicts that, they react in irrational ways.”

A spokesman for WeWork told Quartz that Thinknum’s findings were not true, and its methods of data collection were flawed. For example, WeWork said that Thinknum’s analysis of the usage of WeWork’s member network doesn’t take into account that some of the office space company’s largest members either do not allow their employees to access that network, or restrict access to it.

“This company scraped incomplete data from our member network, which violated the rules of our community,” the spokesman said in a statement. “The data they published and their associated conclusions are factually inaccurate and do not reflect our thriving business.”

This story was updated to include additional information from WeWork.

It’s a long wait until HBO’s Game of Thrones returns — a full 10 months, at least — so fans descended on San Diego Comic-Con in droves Friday to get their Westeros fix from the cast and crew.

To be honest, the cast members on Friday's panel had a disappointing, B-list feel: The notable no-shows included Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington and Maisie Williams. But with Game of Thrones fever at an all-time high — the show averaged 25 million viewers across all platforms in season six, and just racked up a leading 23 Emmy nominations — the Comic-Con crowd was more than happy to take whatever morsels of new information they could get.

The panel was moderated by It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia star/creator Rob McElhenney, who’s a Thrones superfan himself, and he kicked things off with a funny video proving that he’s actually made a number of appearances on the HBO fantasy drama. The sketch parodies the show’s repeated insistence that “Winter Is Coming”; in it, McElhenney plays a minor background character, asking when, exactly, winter will get here. His Sunny co-star Charlie Day even joins him as a Braavos resident who is devastated to hear that winter is coming: “I don’t have any shoes that aren’t open-toed!”

McElhenney got right to the point, addressing the long layoff by asking showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss: “Why do you hate us all so much?” (The new season of Game of Thrones won’t debut until next summer, and will only consist of seven episodes.) Benioff reiterates that it's all about the weather; in season seven, “winter is here, and we’ve got to shoot in places with trees, and we have to wait until the leaves fall off.”

One of the saddest season six moments came when the gentle giant Hodor sacrificed his life, and viewers learned the origin of his name. Benioff recalled his conversation with Weiss and book author George R.R. Martin, and learning of Hodor’s fate: “I just remember looking at Dan, and we were just so amazed and excited, because it’s so freaking cool ... It’s suddenly a tragic turn, and that’s so George R.R. Martin.”

Kristian Nairn, who played Hodor, says he was overwhelmed by the outpouring of fan support following Hodor’s death: “I did not expect it to be so crazy. I’m really flattered.” And he noticed his character’s influence stretched everywhere he went; when he visited L.A. recently, he says, “all the doorstops said ‘Hodor’ on them.”

Another season six death — though much less mourned — was the demise of sadistic villain Ramsay Bolton, following his defeat by Jon Snow. Iwan Rheon, who plays Ramsay, does think his widely hated character had some redeeming characteristics: “Poor guy’s had a tough upbringing. He’s just looking for her father’s love and acceptance all his life, and everyone can relate to that.” But Sophie Turner (Sansa) couldn’t muster up much sympathy for her former tormentor: “Boo-hoo.”

Turner took her own turn on the hot seat when McElhenney asked her about one of season six’s burning questions: Why didn’t Sansa tell Jon about the Knights of the Vale? Turner jokes, “She wanted all the credit … and it makes for really good television.” But she doesn’t believe Sansa has a lot of faith in Jon Snow as a leader: “I’m not sure she thinks Jon is capable of running Winterfell and the North. I don’t think she thinks he has the intellect, the experience. And I concur.”

McElhenney wrapped things up with the ultimate question: Who should win the Iron Throne? Many nominees came up from the cast: Daenerys, Jon Snow, even Brienne of Tarth. (“Someone with honor and integrity,” Nairn says while suggesting Brienne.) Turner actually got booed for suggesting LIttlefinger; “It’d be fun, it’d be quirky,” she says. But Rheon probably has the best idea of all: “Melt the thing down and have a democracy.”

Embed Clinton-Kaine Ticket Makes Debut to Supporters in Miami 4:25 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

A lot of people call Tim Kaine boring, and he doesn't quibble with that.

But while the white male progressive senator from Virginia — now Hillary Clinton's Democratic running mate — is largely uncontroversial, he also plays against type in other ways.

Much of that has to do with his faith.

Raised Catholic and educated by Jesuits in Kansas City, Missouri, Kaine put off legal work after graduating from Harvard Law School to do missionary work in Honduras, where he became fluent in Spanish and caught the public-service bug — an experience he says renewed his commitment to the poor and his opposition to abortion and the death penalty.

But those are his personal views, he says, and they don't necessarily jibe with the political.

As a young lawyer, he defended a death row inmate, while as Virginia governor he oversaw several executions, saying his moral opposition didn't supersede state law.

At the same time, he has supported abortion rights, saying government should not be telling women whether or not they can end a pregnancy.

His Spanish still comes in handy: In 2013, he became the first senator to deliver a full speech in Spanish on the chamber floor. He spoke in Spanish to a roaring Miami crowd Saturday after being introduced officially for the first time as Clinton's running mte.

Related: Fast Facts: Who Is Tim Kaine?

After returning from Honduras, and meeting his wife, Anne Holton, Kaine moved to Richmond, Virginia, where they joined St. Elizabeth Catholic Church, a small, mostly black congregation in a working-class section of the city.

They were married there, and have remained parishioners at St. Elizabeth's throughout his political career. He still sings in the choir every so often.

"He is a bridge-builder among races and communities and regardless of ZIP codes, where people are from or what education they have. He really helps build community," the church's pastor, the Rev. James Arsenault, told NPR.

His faith, along with his relationship with Holton — the daughter of a Virginia governor who integrated public schools, and who attended mostly black schools herself — led him to civil rights work, and ultimately into local politics. They enrolled their kids in locally integrated schools.

As he rose from city council to mayor to governor to senator, religious voters — and black voters — have remained a key to his success.
Story highlights Board of Parole Hearings had recommended her release

He cites brutality of her crime and lack of explanation

(CNN) California Gov. Jerry Brown denied parole to former Manson family member Leslie Van Houten, saying that the murder convict "currently poses an unreasonable danger to society."

Earlier this year, the Board of Parole Hearings had recommended her release.

Van Houten and other followers of Charles Manson were convicted for the 1969 murders of supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary.

In 1994, Van Houten described her part in the killings in a prison interview with CNN's Larry King.

Leslie Van Houten was the youngest of the Charlie Manson followers.

"I went in and Mrs. LaBianca was laying on the floor and I stabbed her in the lower back around 16 times," said Van Houten, who was 19 at the time of the murders.

Gila monsters are iconic Desert Southwest critters. And, as it turns out, they're potentially helpful to people suffering from diabetes.

Gila monster venom (their spit) has something special in it and Arizona State University researchers are hard at work learning more about it.

When Dr. Dale DeNardo opens the security door to a walk-in-closet-sized room, his presence ignites the anger of a couple dozen rattlesnakes that erupt with their signature warning.

At the back of the room, however, lives a colony of 18 shy Gila monsters, owned by ASU’s life sciences department. They’re mildly venomous but rarely bite.

“Always pick them up from behind and we always respect them,” said DeNardo, grabbing a 1-foot-long black and orange Gila monster by the head. “Even though Gila monsters can't kill you, and there's no well-documented case of a death, [their venom is] sort of like taking a hammer to your thumb every 10 to 15 seconds for 45 minutes. It'll be probably the most painful thing you'll feel in your life.”

These docile reptiles were once thought ill-adapted to the Sonoran Desert and that’s what first piqued DeNardo’s interest in studying them.

“I said, they've been here as long as there's been the Sonoran Desert. There's something wrong with that assessment,” he said.

DeNardo said Gila monsters are unique because they prefer a cooler body temperature than most desert lizards. That makes them perfectly suited to nocturnal summer temperatures in the desert. They can also live up to three months without water, thanks to a large bladder that acts as a canteen – holding water that slowly reabsorbs into the animal's body while it waits for monsoon rains to resupply.

There’s something else unique about the Gila monster that’s being studied at ASU.

“Is cure for cancer in this lizard? Probably not. Although there is a protein from its saliva, from its venom, that's used to treat diabetes,” said DeNardo.

That’s where ASU researcher Melissa Wilson Sayres comes in. She’s working to sequence the Gila monster DNA genome. That includes the peptide used in treating type 2 diabetes.

“Generating the genome is not going to make the current drugs for type 2 diabetes immediately better. It might help infer what potential side effects are,” said Wilson Sayres, adding that there are unknown benefits to finding out what else makes up a Gila monster’s DNA.

Right now, the peptide used for diabetes treatments is synthesized for use in humans. But since it occurs naturally in Gila monsters, Wilson Sayres said their saliva could teach us a lot more.

“We need to know how it's working in the system in which it first arose, and then how it's working in the human system,” she said.

Here’s the cool part for the public – you can actually get in on the research. Wilson Sayres is crowd-funding the project to sequence the Gila monster genome. By going to the project’s experiment.com page, you can donate and interact with the scientists directly to learn more.

Hodor on the ones and twos. (Photo from Wikipedia Commons, additional editing by Julia Wick/LAist)

Warning: Game of Thrones spoilers (concerning the character Hodor) up ahead.

The world wept when Hodor met his end on the most recent season of Game Of Thrones. It wasn't just the fact of his dying that was profound. The buildup—the frantic escape from the cave, the revealing of his name's significance—amounted to a rich and proper sendoff for a beloved character of the series.

Some may have wondered what was in store for actor Kristian Nairn, who played Hodor. On Thursday night they got their answer at Comic-Con, when Nairn showed up at an afterparty at San Diego's OMNIA Nightclub to spin some house tracks for the adoring crowd, TMZ reported. That's right: Hodor is a house DJ. And, according to The Daily Mail, the 40-year-old Nairn has been at it for 16 years, so last night's performance wasn't just some publicity-grabbing ploy.

Several attendees recorded the performance. As you can see in the first video, Nairn makes a nod to GoT when the words "Rave of Thrones" flash on the screen behind him. It also sounds like Narin's got a taste for old-school house jams that take a bit from the Chicago and Detroit house scenes.

Holdin' the door and droppin' the bass—how can you possibly not love Hodor?

(CNN) ISIS is claiming responsibility for a joint suicide bombing Saturday that killed dozens of people during a peaceful demonstration by a minority group in Kabul, Afghanistan.

"I saw tens of people laying down in blood around me and hundreds of people running away from the scene," said Fatima Faizi, an Afghan freelance journalist.

So far, 80 bodies and more than 260 wounded people were taken to hospitals in Kabul, according to Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry.

Sayed Hamed, 30, attended the protest but left before the explosions. He was about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away.

"As I was watching (from my hotel) and some (people) were running toward the scene and some were crying coming from the scene," he wrote in an email to CNN. "It was a very sad situation, and everyone was trying to find their relatives or friends."

The attack, the worst in months in terms of casualties, drew attention to ISIS instead of the Taliban, which had been blamed for recent bombings.

Two ISIS fighters detonated their suicide belts among the protesters, according to ISIS' media wing, Amaq. A third attacker was killed by security forces before detonating his bomb, according to an Afghan security official speaking on condition of anonymity.

The White House condemned the "horrific attack," adding that it was made "all the more despicable by the fact that it targeted a peaceful demonstration."

The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office echoed the sentiment. FCO Minister Alok Sharma said "the UK remains steadfast and resolute in our long-term commitment to the Afghan people. We will continue to work with the Government of Afghanistan to help build a more stable and secure Afghanistan."

The jihadist terrorist group has been stepping up attacks worldwide -- and most recently in Afghanistan -- while losing territory in its self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq and Syria.

The blast in Kabul on Saturday afternoon happened during a demonstration by members of the Hazara, a Shiite minority group, near the Afghan Parliament building and Kabul University. Declaring a national day of mourning Saturday evening, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani ordered flags in the nation to be flown at half-staff.

The protesters were demanding a planned power line be rerouted through their poverty-stricken Bamyan province to ensure electricity in the relatively isolated area west of Kabul.

Accounting for up to one-fifth of Afghanistan's population, Hazaras, a Persian-speaking people who mainly live in central Afghanistan, have long been branded outsiders for their Shia faith and far Asian features in the country dominated by followers of the Sunni branch of Islam, according to a 2008 National Georgraphic article

The Hazara in the past have demanded the government protect them from attacks blamed on the Sunni Taliban and ISIS.

Protesters in November march with coffins of decapitated Hazaras in Kabul.

On November 11, thousands of protesters marched through Kabul with coffins containing the decapitated bodies of seven Hazaras, four men, two women and one child. The protesters called for justice for the beheadings, chanting slogans seeking death for the Taliban and ISIS.

Saturday's attack is the latest in a rash of kidnappings and bombings in Kabul, which have heightened security fears in the nation's capital.

The Taliban have claimed responsibility for other attacks.

Three weeks ago, two Taliban suicide bombers killed 34 people when they attacked a convoy of buses carrying newly graduated police officers in Kabul.

On June 20 in the Afghan capital, a suicide bomber killed 14 Nepali security contractors who worked for the Canadian embassy.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack in a text message sent to media organizations.

U.S. and other diplomats were barred from traveling by road the short distance from the city's international airport to their diplomatic missions. Instead, they were ferried by helicopter.

Meanwhile, the 14-year war against the Taliban in the countryside is as bloody as ever. While the Taliban is the dominant insurgent force in the central Asia country, ISIS has been establishing a presence.

U.S. President Barack Obama announced on July 6 that he would slow the planned drawdown of the 9.800 troops supporting the Afghan country because of the precarious security situation, including the emerging threat from ISIS.

In the last 18 months, 38 Americans, both civilian and military, have died in the country.

Obama noted the United States was no longer engaged in a major ground war as it was in 2009 when he took over with plans to end American involvement, but he said, "Afghanistan ... remains one of the poorest countries in the world. It is going to continue to take time for them to build up military capacity that we sometimes take for granted. And given the enormous challenges they face, the Afghan people will need the partnership of the world, led by the United States, for many years to come."

Other ISIS attacks in Afghanistan

ISIS attacks or ISIS-inspired attacks in Afghanistan include:



• April 18, 2015 - A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up in front of a bank in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, killing at least 33 people and injuring more than 100 others. "On April 18, local media received text messages allegedly from Shahidullah Shahid, a key figure in the establishment of Wilayat Khorasan, claiming responsibility on behalf of ISIS for the attack," the Institute for the Study of War reported. Wilayat Khorasan is the ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The attack is believed to have been conducted by ISIS or one of its affiliates.



• January 13, 2016 - Three ISIS fighters launched an attack on the Pakistani consulate in Jalalabad. The first operative reportedly detonated his explosives while attacking the consulate's guards and a second bomber detonated his device inside the building. A local official said six people were killed, as well as the three assailants. The attack is believed to have been carried out by ISIS or one of its affiliates.



• June 5, 2016 - The Khorasan Province of ISIS claimed it had carried out the assassination of Afghan member of parliament Sher Wali Wardak. Wardak was killed by an IED while in his car in Kabul. The attack is believed to have been carried out by an ISIS affiliate.



• June 20, 2016 - The Khorasan province of ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a bus carrying Nepalese security guards in Kabul. At least 16 people were killed in the attack. ISIS identified the bomber as Irfanullah Ahmed and published a photo of him. But the Afghan Taliban also claimed responsibility for the attack. The origins of the attack are unknown.
DENVER — Poisonous plants and animals aren’t really out to get us.

It just seems that way sometimes.

In nature, toxins are simply a component of a successful survival system. Poison and venom are natural biological adaptations that enable a species to protect itself from predators, capture prey or alter its environment to its own advantage.

So when humans are targeted by these sometimes-deadly defense mechanisms, it’s often our own fault. That’s because most toxin-containing flora and fauna give ample warning of their lethality. Called aposematism, these signals, which are frequently visual but can also involve smell and sound, are nature’s equivalent of a red flag.

The bright-yellow color of the golden poison frog from Colombia’s Choco forest is a warning to potential predators to back off — or succumb to batrachotoxin. Named after the Greek word for frog (batrachos), this poison, which is secreted on the frog’s skin, is 250 times more powerful than strychnine on a weight basis; it stops nerves from transmitting impulses, causing cardiac arrest.

Scientists know that, in the wild, these frogs get their poison from dining on insects like beetles and ants. But they haven’t yet determined how the insect toxins travel from the frog’s stomach to its skin. The five live golden poison frogs on display at “The Power of Poison,” a special exhibition at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, eat toxin-free flies and crickets, rendering them harmless.

Equally harmless (thank God) are replicas, enlarged to three times their actual size, of creepy-crawly forest dwellers like the wandering spider. Packing venom powerful enough to fell a horse, this colorful spider is posed in a defensive posture, its four front legs raised menacingly.

Defensive bites usually inject only small amounts of venom, making them painful but rarely fatal — and that’s good news for any creature that risks annoying this aggressive arachnid.

Stephen King in Pet Sematary. Credit: Everett Collection

One of the main reasons Stephen King is our modern master of horror is because he understands how important setting is to a good story. He lures readers into a false sense of security by setting so many of his best stories in idyllic small towns where things are supposed to be perfect, and then lets things happen from there. The lifelong Maine resident has used his home state and the region as inspiration for some of his most terrifying books, from It to Salem's Lot, and filmmakers adapting his stories understand just how important a part the setting plays to whatever King tale they might be putting to film. That's why even if the movie based off of one of King’s stories is set in but isn’t filmed in New England, you’d probably have a hard time telling the difference.

RELATED: 60 Novels: An Essential Reading List



From "The Loveliest Town in Canada" to "The Fun Center of Ohio," here are some of the best real-life spots you can visit, some of which are in Maine, others were picked because they looked like it. Whether you've never actually read Stephen King, are a casual fan, or have read every book twenty times and named your first-born Cujo, there’s something perfect for everyone.

Orrington, ME

Relevance: Where King was inspired to write Pet Sematary. There was indeed a pet cemetery — it was behind the house the Kings were renting. The house used in the film version is a little ways away, in Hancock, Maine (and looks a lot like the one he rented.)

About: Orrington has a population of about 4,000. It is minutes away from the busier town of Ellsworth, where a few parts of the film version were shot.

Lodging: Orrington itself does not have any hotels, but you can stay four miles away in Bangor for as little as $52 a night.

Of note: It was the birthplace of Edward A. Pierce, one of the founders of Merrill Lynch, as well as home to the first American-born Methodist minister and the first female master mariner in North America.

New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada

Relevance: The town where they filmed It. See the pretty places where Tim Curry dressed up as Pennywise and cemented himself in your nightmares forever.

About: New Westminster is located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, with a population of about 40,000 people. It’s about 30 minutes away from downtown Vancouver.

Lodging: A night at a B&B starts at $82, a night, depending on the season; hotels start at $70.

Of note: The New Westminster Salmonbellies are one of the oldest professional lacrosse teams in Canada. New Westminster is also the location of the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame.

Portland, ME

Relevance: The birthplace of Stephen King.

About: Portland is Maine's largest city, with a population of over 66,000 residents.

Lodging: A motel room can cost as little as $80 a night, but if you want to stay in the historic waterfront section of the city, you’re looking at $200 or more for a room.

Of note: With about 230 restaurants, Portland is believed to have more restaurants per capita than any other city in the country. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named for Portland, Maine. The list of notable people from Portland is pretty long.

SK Tours of Maine, LLC, Bangor, ME

Relevance: Tours of locations in Bangor, Maine, made famous by Stephen King.

About: Bangor serves as the fictional town of Derry in many of King’s works, including It, Insomnia, and 11/22/63.

Lodging: Rooms in Bangor start at about $76 a night.

Of note: SK Tours is run by Penney and Stu Tinker, who also owned and operated a King-centric bookshop for 20 years. Each tour is approximately three hours long and highlights about 30 spots that pertain to Stephen King. King still owns a home in Bangor.

Bonus: The remaining car used in the filming of Christine resides in Pensacola, Florida. You can’t visit her, but she's available for events.

Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada

Relevance: Filming location of the film adaptation of King’s novel The Dead Zone. Also filmed here: Trapped in Paradise, The Ref, and Canadian Bacon.

About: Niagara-on-the-Lake is a Canadian town located in Southern Ontario. Nicknamed "The Loveliest Town in Canada," it has a population of about 16,000 residents, but looks deceptively like New England.

Lodging: Motel rooms are as cheap as $71 a night, depending on the time of year.

Of note: It is the only municipality in Canada whose elected leader is designated as Lord Mayor. And the town is home to the Shaw Festival, a series of theatrical productions featuring the works of George Bernard Shaw.

The Ohio State Reformatory, Mansfield, OH.

Relevance: The filming location of The Shawshank Redemption. The book and film are both set in Maine, but this old prison fit the bill.

About: The prison, located in Mansfield, Ohio, was built between 1886 and 1910 and remained in operation until 1990. Since the filming in 1994, several sections of the prison have been torn down, and the building is undergoing renovations. There are still sections of the prison available for guided or self-guided tours in April through August.

Lodging: Hotel rooms start for as little as $49.

Of note: The prison has been used for several films, television shows, and videos, including Air Force One, Tango & Cash, and Ghost Asylum. The town's nickname is "The Fun Center of Ohio" and is home to about 50,000 people.

Brownsville, OR

Relevance: It is the setting for the fictional Castle Rock, Oregon, in the film Stand by Me.

About: Located in Linn County, the quaint little town is home to just over 2,000 people. It is the county’s oldest town.

Lodging: The town itself doesn’t appear to have any hotels, but you can stay close by, in Halsey, for as little as $64 a night.

Of note: In the novella the film is based on, The Body, Castle Rock is located in Maine (and is used in several other of King’s works), but director Rob Reiner changed it to Oregon for the movie.

The Stanley Hotel, Estes Park, CO

Relevance: This one has no connection to New England, but makes the list because it served as King’s influence for The Overlook Hotel in The Shining, after he stayed there for one night in 1974 (in Room 217), so we couldn’t not put it on a list like this.

About: Opened in 1909, this 140-room hotel is located at 333 Wonder View Avenue, Estes Park, Colorado. It offers a panoramic view of the Rockies, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Lodging: Depending on what time of year you go, a night at the hotel can start as low as $148.

Of note: Rumors of paranormal activity at the hotel existed before King made the hotel famous. The television show Ghost Hunters filmed at the hotel twice in 2006, and it was also featured on an episode of Ghost Adventures in 2010.
SAN DIEGO — When giggling stoner guru Seth Rogen invites you to watch an animated feature he wrote by the name of Sausage Party — and when you walk past posters that basically turn Rogen's character, Frank the hot dog, into a dick joke — it's fair to say your expectations are set to minimum.

Probably the last thing you're expecting is a meditation on life, death, race, diversity, religion and reality. Buried here is a lesson — be gentle when contradicting people's firmly-held beliefs — that Democrats especially would do well to learn as they hone their outreach to Republican voters this year.

SEE ALSO: Amy Schumer, Seth Rogen stump for equal pay in Bud Light's latest fake political ad

I don't want to oversell it. Sausage Party, which Rogen and company screened here at Comic-Con for the first time, may be a Pixar-style tale of anthropomorphic supermarket items trying to understand their place in the world, but it still offers the R-rated, foul-mouthed gross-out humor you would expect from the title.

"Animators are sick people," Rogen told the audience.

"Animators are sick people," Rogen told the audience, explaining why he actually had to tone down their version of the — spoiler alert — food-on-food orgy near the end of the flick. (The scene apparently stumped the ratings-making MPAA, which eventually decided that if it's food, it's not actually sex.)

The important thing is that none of the (mercifully brief) gross-out comedy moments feel forced. This is no cynical ploy by a big studio. It's all in service to a very subversive, occasionally charming story that appears to have sprung fully formed from Rogen's fevered brain (even though he spent a decade on it, and has three co-screenwriters).

The setup: Frank and his girlfriend Brenda the bun are looking forward to being taken by the Gods, i.e. humans, so they can finally quit their packaging and be reunited in the Great Beyond. Of course, they find out things are not as they appear and go on a quest to discover the truth.

All of the implications of having a sentient supermarket are explored here much as a Pixar or Disney team might. It's easy to imagine Ratatouille director Brad Bird, say, coming up with the "Imperishables," a racially diverse group of immortal items named Firewater, Grits and Twink.

It's just that Bird wouldn't have them pass around a kazoo filled with pot, or casually discuss gay sex. He might have Grits reference In the Heat of the Night actor Sidney Poitier's famous line ("they call me MISTER Grits"), but he would certainly not have him mention the supermarket food he hates the most: "those dumb crackers!"

It's fair to say that there are a lot of racially-charged jokes like this, the kind of late-night standup comic material that sounds far more controversial out of context. But even in the theater, your jaw is likely to hit the floor at what Rogen is blithely trying to get away with here:

Example near the beginning: a jar of sauerkraut with a mustache sings about "exterminating the juice." Yeah, they went there. — Chris Taylor (@FutureBoy) July 22, 2016

But Rogen is an equal-opportunity offender, and everything balances out nicely in the end. The sauerkraut gets its comeuppance. Sammy Bagel Jr., voiced by Edward Norton doing his best Woody Allen impersonation, learns to love the Lavash bread character.

Yes, the potato talks in a comedy Irish accent, and there's a very nerdy piece of gum in a wheelchair that speaks exactly like Stephen Hawking. But these aren't one-dimensional caricatures; most get a smattering of interesting non-stereotypical quirks.

And far outnumbering the racial jokes are the dad jokes. "How do you like them apples?" crows the villain of the piece (who is literally a douche). "What, us?" says a nearby basket of apples. This formula is repeated a dozen times. Overall, oddly, it feels more family friendly than Family Guy. Like South Park, it has a heart.

The ending — well, the multiple endings — have a very science-fictiony feel. Rogen takes the premise to its Shirley Jackson-esque conclusion, which will have you suddenly wondering who you're supposed to be rooting for, and then gets extraordinarily meta for an encore. You've never seen the fourth wall torn down quite like this.

In short, don't dismiss Sausage Party as just a bit of summer fun. Rogen may giggle and joke about sex and drugs, but he can't help being smart, too. He has important things to say, whether he realizes it or not.

Sausage Party, directed by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon, is scheduled to be released Aug. 12.
Donald Trump closed out the Republican National Convention on Thursday with the Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” and The Stones aren’t too thrilled about it.

Turtles Say Use of 'Happy Together' at RNC Was Unauthorized

The band took to Twitter to clarify that the song use is not an endorsement for Trump. “The Rolling Stones do not endorse Donald Trump. You Can’t Always Get What You Want was used without the band’s permission."

The Rolling Stones do not endorse Donald Trump. You Can't Always Get What You Want was used without the band's permission. — The Rolling Stones (@RollingStones) July 22, 2016

The Rolling Stones have continuously asked Trump to refrain from using their music. In May, Trump walked out for his Indiana primary victory speech to “Start Me Up,” with a rep for the band telling Billboard at the time, “The Rolling Stones have never given permission to the Trump campaign to use their songs. [The band] have requested that they cease all use immediately.”

Prior to Trump’s campaign use of “Start Me Up,” The Stones made public their distaste for the use of “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” and “Brown Sugar” during Trump's campaign. The Rolling Stones are one of many artists who have asked Trump to stay clear of their hits while campaigning for the presidency, including Adele and R.E.M.

Verizon is closing in on a deal to buy Yahoo’s core business for about $5 billion, according to sources familiar with the talks.

The telco giant has long been considered the favorite to buy Yahoo’s internet assets, which it wants to combine with AOL, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion.

Part of Verizon’s pitch to Yahoo’s board is that it is the logical choice, since it is already operating a similar business. The concept of such a deal is to combine its advertising tech assets and become the third alternative to leaders Facebook and Google. Both companies also have extensive media assets.

"If Verizon bid that high, they definitely got it, because they’re the safe bet for Yahoo," said a rival bidder.

And insider sources at Yahoo, whose efforts are being led by board member Tom McInerney, also said that it wanted a deal that was easiest to close. "There is no worry with Verizon about financing or as many questions about integration," said one source. "It can swallow this without a lot of trouble."

And Verizon raised the price it was willing to pay in its most recent offer for Yahoo, delivered this week. But some members of Verizon’s board had previously expressed concern about the deal’s price tag and were worried about other costs. That includes the revelation that search partner Mozilla had been given advantageous and pricey termination terms in a deal struck by Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer.

Speaking of Mayer, if the transaction is completed it would be an ironic turn, given that a key exec on the Verizon side is AOL’s Tim Armstrong. He and Mayer worked together at Google many years ago. And most importantly, as recently as two years ago, Mayer had rejected Armstrong’s efforts to merge the two companies. AOL went with Verizon, which would now be swallowing up Yahoo.

Yes, the snake eventually eats itself! Also, Armstrong is a very good salesman!

But the deal is not done. As recently as yesterday, Yahoo was asking an investor group led by Quicken Loans’ Dan Gilbert for more details on their offer. Private equity firm TPG has also been very aggressive in the bidding.

Bloomberg, as well as CNBC, earlier reported that Verizon was in exclusive talks to buy Yahoo.

WikiLeaks has published 20,000 emails from the Democratic National Committee.

The leak, which also includes 8,000 file attachments, went live on Friday morning. WikiLeaks bills it as part of its "new Hillary Leaks series."

RELEASE: 19,252 emails from the US Democratic National Committee https://t.co/kpFxYDoNyX#Hillary2016#FeelTheBernpic.twitter.com/Pft8wnOujl - WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 22, 2016

"The leaks come from the accounts of seven key figures in the DNC: Communications Director Luis Miranda (10770 emails), National Finance Director Jordon Kaplan (3797 emails), Finance Chief of Staff Scott Comer (3095 emails), Finanace [sic] Director of Data & Strategic Initiatives Daniel Parrish (1472 emails), Finance Director Allen Zachary (1611 emails), Senior Advisor Andrew Wright (938 emails) and Northern California Finance Director Robert (Erik) Stowe (751 emails)," the site advertises.

WikiLeaks is presenting the emails as a searchable database, complete with an optional spam filter.

The emails span from last January to the end of May.

The site does not specifically address who leaked the documents, but hacker Guccifer 2.0 who recently breached the DNC servers confirmed via electronic message that the emails came from that hack.

"At last!" he wrote.
Is Your Sales Process Broken?

Let's be honest. Sales in a typical organization (most organizations in fact), is seriously broken. But rather than focusing on the obvious dysfunction, management is busy with incremental improvement initiatives:

Sales training Sales force automation (technology of various types) Bolt-on lead-generation activities (outsourced telemarketing, for example) New commission structures and incentives

Trouble is, none of these activities actually address the root cause of the dysfunction.

Sure, they may offer a temporary lift but things always go back to the way they were.
Are you ready for a trip back to one of the horror genre’s most feared woods? EW can reveal that Lionsgate’s upcoming film The Woods is actually a new, and previously secret, sequel to horror classic The Blair Witch Project, arriving in theaters on Sept. 16. Titled, simply, Blair Witch, the found footage movie stars James Allen McCune (Showtime’s Shameless) as the brother of Heather Donahue’s character from the original 1999 horror film, who sets out to discover what happened to his long-missing sister.

Blair Witch is directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett, whose previous collaborations include 2013’s home invasion horror-comedy You’re Next and the following year’s Dan Stevens-starring action-thriller The Guest. The film was shot secretly in Vancouver last year but has actually been hiding in plain sight under the name of The Woods. In May, Lionsgate released a trailer for “The Woods,” which featured footage from the film accompanied by a creepy cover of The Police’s “Every Breath You Take.” Blair Witch is being publicly shown Friday for the first time at Comic-Con in San Diego at an event which has been billed as a screening for The Woods.

“The Woods was our working title,” says director Wingard. “When we signed on to it, we knew that [the name] was eventually going to be changed. To us, it wasn’t even going to be part of the marketing. But I think Lionsgate made a really smart decision, using that.”

This marketing slight-of-hand has a precedent in the franchise. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, The Blair Witch Project tracked the increasingly terrifying travails of three student filmmakers (played by Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard) making a documentary near Burkittsville, Maryland, about the titular local legend. The film cost a mere $60,000 but grossed $140 million in America alone, in part thanks to a marketing campaign which led many to believe that the footage which comprised the movie really had been “found” and that the events depicted were real.

In time, Myrick and Sánchez’s film would prove hugely influential, helping to usher in the found footage craze which reached its commercial zenith with the Paranormal Activity movies. “It’s still the golden standard for found footage, in a way” says writer Barrett about the original Blair Witch Project. “It’s pretty much unparalleled in terms of its commitment towards reality, to the point where characters [are] filming their feet while they’re yelling at each other.”

Blair Witch is the third in the franchise but the first since 2000’s Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, which abandoned the found footage format and performed modestly at the box office, earning $26 million. Remarkably, although Blair Witch was shot in May and June of 2015, there has been almost no chatter on the internet about the film’s connection to The Blair Witch Project.

“It really has been fascinating, all the CIA-level security that we have put around this project, from the very beginning,” says Jason Constantine, President, Acquisitions and Co-Productions, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, who played a lead role in developing the film. “I’ve been at Lionsgate for 16 years, and I’ve had the privilege of working on a lot of movies that I love, and are a lot of fun: horror movies, and action movies, and Oscar movies. But never have we ever set out to make a reboot movie, and keep it in total secrecy, with a brand that’s as well known to the public as this one. It’s incredible to think about how many people needed to know about it to bring this movie to life — and yet we ended up not having any leaks in that regard.”

The release of Blair Witch in September will be the culmination of a long-held dream for Constantine, who says he feels a personal connection with the original film, having been present in the audience when the movie played the Sundance Film Festival in 1999. “I was at that first Sundance screening, when the movie world-premiered at the Egyptian Theater,” he recalls. “I thought it was incredible, and terrifying, and really innovative.”

In 2003, Lionsgate purchased Artisan Entertainment, the company which distributed The Blair Witch Project and held the rights to the franchise. “I always felt this was a brand that, if done correctly, would be a great horror movie to bring back to audiences,” says Constantine. “However, you had to do it right or not at all. We explored a couple different avenues but I always felt it really came down to having the right creative take. It had to be the right filmmaking team.”

Constantine started to believe he had found that team after seeing You’re Next, which Lionsgate announced in September 2011 that it had acquired for distribution. Wingard and Barrett’s tale of family reunion which goes violently awry would not ultimately set the box office alight, a victim, arguably, of its own genre-bending inventiveness. But the pair’s darkly humorous, if still memorably brutal, film caught the attention of both horror aficionados and studio development executives. And their profile was further raised by the duo’s involvement with the found footage horror anthology V/H/S, which screened at the 2012 Sundance Festival, and its sequel, V/H/S2, whose creators also included Sánchez and Blair Witch Project producer Gregg Hale.

“As soon as you have any kind of success whatsoever, you suddenly get all these meetings where they want you to remake whatever film resembles the one that you just made as much as possible,” says Barrett. “Because Adam and I, our first visible successes were the first V/H/S and You’re Next, we got offered a lot of found footage home invasion films. Additionally, we got offered remakes of every kind of horror movie you could possibly think of. We turned them all down.”

In February 2013, Constantine invited the pair to a secret meeting at Lionsgate where he personally pitched them on the idea of writing and directing a new Blair Witch movie. “We were blown away by Adam Wingard’s complete mastery of the genre in You’re Next and felt that Adam, and Simon, and Keith (Calder), and Jessica (Wu), the producers, were an extraordinary filmmaking unit,” says Constantine. “When we saw You’re Next and saw [V/H/S], it was like, ‘You know what? Adam Wingard and his writing partner are the guys that we should go to, to [make] a reboot of Blair Witch.’ And so, we arranged a secret meeting with them, we pitched them the idea.”

It was an offer the duo felt they couldn’t refuse. “This was different for several reasons,” says Barrett. “One of which was, we had a friendship with Eduardo Sánchez and Gregg Hale, from working on V/H/S2 with them. Beyond that, we were just such fans of the original film and its mythology. It was like, ‘We can’t let anyone else do this.’ We were refusing to let another filmmaker mess with it, because it was something that we really loved.”

“We were already doing The Guest when we were first contacted,” recalls Wingard. “But, for me, as soon as the idea of doing a Blair Witch movie was brought up, I instantly jumped on it. I still remembered all the old mythology that went online when the first film came out.”

Constantine’s offer also dovetailed nicely with Wingard and Barrett’s desire to make a full-on, no-nonsense fright flick. “The funny thing is, I’ve always been considered a horror filmmaker and I don’t feel like I’ve made a real horror movie,” says the director. “I mean, You’re Next is basically a horror-comedy, The Guest is more a meta-breakdown of horror films mixed with a thriller. One of the interesting things for me was, actually saying, ‘I’m going to try to make the scariest film that’s ever been made.’”

In March 2013, Lionsgate closed deals with Wingard and Barrett, while also informing Sánchez, Hale, and Myrick in whose hands they had placed the future of their creation. Instead of publicizing the fact that Lionsgate now had a plan in place to reboot one of the most famous horror brands of all-time, Constantine asked that all concerned keep the matter a secret.

“We live in an age where it’s harder and harder for a movie to be a genuine surprise for an audience, because of the internet, because of Twitter, because of all the discussions that can happen online,” says the Lionsgate executive. “Sometimes, you want to embrace that for a movie, but we really felt, on this film, that it would be great if audiences could be genuinely surprised.”

Barrett and Wingard embraced the idea of keeping the project off the grid. “Adam and I both thought that was super cool,” says the former. “We were really excited by that. [With] V/H/S, V/H/S 2, and especially You’re Next, we wouldn’t even tell people that those movies existed until their premieres were announced. That was our way to make that a cool thing. In this era of social media, and of everyone hyping everything, we’ve always felt that is the right approach: give people less, don’t tell them exactly what it is, let them be surprised.”

Barrett also had the advantage of some professional experience in the field of keeping secrets. “I was a licensed private investigator for about 10 years before I started making any kind of living in the film industry,” he explains. “So, I’m actually pretty cagey in general. I learned that the key to keeping a secret is, you have to keep it from everyone. In fact, I had a meeting recently with a studio that was trying to hire us to do another secret project. [Laughs] I couldn’t tell them about the first one and so it was a weird conversation. But I was like, ‘You’re just going to have to trust me, I’m good at keeping secrets.’”

Wingard says he and Barrett were mostly allowed to develop the script without excessive input or interference from Lionsgate. “They knew they wanted it to be a continuation of the first film, using Heather’s brother,” says Wingard. “That was what they came to us with. From there, we were left to our own devices to figure it out. There were a lot of things that I could still remember watching the first film, as a mega-fan as a kid, thinking, what I wanted out of a sequel. Whenever I saw Book of Shadows, they just didn’t touch on all these things I wanted to see. My entrance was, How do I do the ultimate version of this? I wanted it to be a haunted house ride where you’re just strapped in and, once it gets going, there’s no turning back and you’re just going full-on into all these intense set pieces.” Not part of the plan? Featuring cast members from the first film. “It would have been cool,” says Wingard. “[But] it was one of those things where, we wanted the movie to stand on its own.”

Barrett handed in his first draft, appropriately enough, on Oct. 31, 2013, and, over the next nine months, the script was developed and refined, with each new version bearing the name “The Woods” on the title page. In the fall of 2014, Calder and Wu were officially brought onto the project, joining Roy Lee (The Strangers) and Steven Schneider (Insidious) as producers. In the spring of last year, the team began the search for actors. Neither the potential cast members nor their representatives were told the real nature of the project during the audition process, during which actors read from fake, Barrett-penned script pages.

“This was a huge process that I am still somewhat embittered about because it required work from me, which I despise,” Barrett half-jokes. “I have to say, I imagine it was a desire to work with Adam that even got them through these bizarre scenes, because they can’t have had much confidence in the actual scenes themselves.”

Finally, the Blair Witch team settled on the film’s cast of McCune, Valorie Curry (The Following), Callie Hernandez (From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series), Brandon Scott (Grey’s Anatomy), Wes Robinson (American Dreams), and Corbin Reid (Words With Girls). “When we made the decision to cast everybody, each role, then we gave them the opportunity to read the script,” says Constantine. “I had a conversation with each one of them personally to explain to them what they were about to read, and the importance of the secrecy, not just today but for the rest of the production.”

“Fortunately, their reaction was, they were very excited,” says Barrett. “They were thrilled. Wes Robinson, he was a huge fan of the original, and, really more than anyone else was very, like, ‘That’s cool.’”

Security remained tight during the shoot itself. While the cast and senior crew members had access to the real script, others were given a fake screenplay, from which all telltale references had been excised. “I think it was the UPM (unit production manager), he was talking to one of the producers,” recalls Wingard. “He said, ‘This script is really cool but it seems like a real knock-off of The Blair Witch.’ It was like, ‘Oh, wait, you haven’t actually gotten the real script? We should get that to you.’”

The secrecy even extended to the corporate corridors of Lionsgate itself. “Only a very small handful of people at Lionsgate knew what the film was,” says Barrett. “We were working with Jason Constantine and Eda Kowan (Executive Vice President, Acquisitions & Co-Productions). This was just their own secret project and basically they kept it a secret even from everyone there. So, because of that, it wasn’t that hard for us to keep it a secret from our crew. If, for example, they were to call someone at Lionsgate and say, ‘What is this film?’ they’d get a very sincere, incorrect, answer, from someone who wasn’t even lying to them, but just wasn’t in the loop.”

While the cast may have been scared to death about divulging the true nature of the shoot, they didn’t look terrified enough for Wingard who set about thinking up ways to help them deliver suitably shocked performances. “I found myself trying out all kinds of tricks,” says the director. “This movie has lot of moments where people have to seem really surprised. I kind of developed my new jump-scare system. I have a collection of these air horns that I would bring on set. I call them my ‘scare horns.’ If you want a real reaction, it’s not good enough to just tell somebody to act surprised, or even to smack two wood blocks together, which is what some people do. You’ve got to really make them jump. There’s nothing like a good air horn right behind an actor’s ear to make them jump and give you an appropriate scream when you need it.”

Having successfully maintained the Woods ruse up to this point, Lionsgate doubled down on it when the time came to release the film’s first trailer. “On You’re Next, we developed a relationship with Tim Palen (Lionsgate Head of Marketing), who is their kind of marketing wizard,” says Barrett. “He was one of the few people that we wanted to make sure was looped in at an early stage, because we knew he would have some sort of creative, outside-of-the-box thinking towards this film. And he certainly does! [Laughs] He had total confidence in this vision of, It’s been amazing that this has been kept secret so far, so let’s take advantage of that.”

Lionsgate also screened a work-in-progress version of the film for the makers of the original Blair Witch Project. “They’ve all seen the movie and have all given us their approval,” says Wingard. “Thank God!”

Wingard and Barrett have some ideas as to where the franchise could go next, if audiences also give the film a collective thumbs-up when the film is released in September. “We know where we would take it if there is a sequel,” the director says. For the moment, however, the pair are still getting accustomed to actually saying the name of the film they have been working on for past three years. “Now that we’re having conversations about it with people at Lionsgate and their marketing department, I still find those terribly unnerving,” says Barrett. “’The movie that comes out in September’ is how I prefer to reference it.”
