Smart watches aren’t exactly models of efficiency—they require one hand to operate while the other wrist wears it. A team of Carnegie Mellon University researchers figured there had to be a better way to pinch, swipe, and click using just the hand that wears it.

They tapped into the existing smart-watch sensors like gyroscopes and accelerometers and, using machine learning, taught an off-the-shelf Samsung Galaxy Gear smart watch to recognize five different gestures performed by the hand wearing the watch. It included relatively fine gestures like pinch and tap, plus larger hand movements such as rub, squeeze, and wave.

"We wanted to do gestures that are not awkward for people to do while they’re on their smart watch,” says Julian Andres Ramos Rojas, a PhD student in Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute.

Sensors in the smart watch can recognize simple gestures from the hand that wears it.

The research team turned to 10 volunteers to test the accuracy of its system. Overall, it was about 87 percent accurate. Rojas estimates that a commercial version would have to be more than 95 percent accurate.

Smart watches in their modern form are still relatively new, and their makers are experimenting with different input methods. They often involve bulky buttons or lots of tapping or scrolling with the user’s finger.

Gesture recognition would dramatically improve the functionality of smart watches, which have struggled to take off. Tying up both hands to interact with a smart watch often doesn’t make much sense. Someone with dirty hands might not want to touch his screen just to change the music.

“(There) are times when speed, subtlety, hands-free interaction, or pure enjoyment call for gesture control,” according to Stephen Lake, CEO of gesture control armband maker Thalmic Labs. “When we have the opportunity to further immerse ourselves into an experience or provide a shortcut to the alternative, gesture control can prevail.”

Smart-watch makers are in the early stages of adding gesture control. Late last year, Google made it possible to add a few gesture controls to Android smart watches. Users can flick, shake, or lift their wrist to interact. The Carnegie Mellon team’s approach differs in that users can actually make relatively fine finger movements and still have their watch pick them up.

The researchers believe their work could be especially useful in health care, where it could be used by patients with motor neuron diseases. It would also be possible to use the technology to control more than a smart watch; phones, laptops, and virtual- or augmented-reality headsets can also benefit from gesture control.

Rojas says researchers are already looking beyond smart watches for interacting with our devices. Another Carnegie Mellon team is working on turning skin into a touch pad (see “Use Your Arm as a Smart-Watch Touch Pad”). But we aren’t likely to all immediately jump to the most sci-fi solution.

"I don’t think we’re going to settle into a single mode of interaction. Instead, it’s going to be this really nice combination of techniques,” Rojas says.
On the first day of the sprawling RSA security industry conference in San Francisco, a giant screen covering the wall of the Moscone Center’s cavernous lobby cycles through the names and headshots of keynote speakers: steely-eyed National Security Agency director Michael Rogers in a crisp military uniform; bearded and besuited Whitfield Diffie and Ron Rivest, legendary inventors of seminal encryption protocols that made the Internet safe for communication and commerce. And then there’s Moxie Marlinspike, peering somberly into the distance wearing a bicycle jersey and an 18-inch-tall helmet shaped like a giant spear of asparagus. “It was the only picture I could find,” Marlinspike deadpans as we walk into the building.

Even without the vegetable headwear, Marlinspike’s wire-thin 6'2" frame and topknot of blond dreadlocks doesn’t fit the usual profile of the crypto world’s spooks and academ­ics, nor RSA’s corporate types. Walking toward the ball­room where he’s set to speak on the annual Cryptographers’ Panel, however, he tells me it’s not his first time at the conference.

In fact, when Marlinspike made his debut visit to RSA 20 years ago, as a teenager, he wasn’t invited. Lured by the promise of seeing his cryptographer heroes in person, he snuck in, somehow snagging a confer­ence badge without paying the $1,000 registration fee. Later, he made the mistake of handing it off to friends who were more interested in scoring lunch than in hearing about pseudo-random-­number generators. They were spotted and kicked out. RSA organizers must have gone so far as to report Marlinspike’s mischief to law enforcement, he says; years later he requested his FBI file and discovered a reference to the incident.

A middle-aged man in a sports coat and jeans approaches us, carrying a Wall Street Journal. He shakes Marlin­spike’s hand and thanks him for creating the encrypted messaging app Signal, which the man says was recommended to him by a friend, a former FBI agent. Marlinspike looks back at me with raised eyebrows.

Signal, widely considered the most secure and easiest-to-use free encrypted messaging and voice-calling app, is the reason he’s been invited to speak as part of the very same crypto Jedi Council he had worshipped as a teenager. Marlinspike designed Signal to bring uncrackable encryp­tion to regular ­people. And though he hadn’t yet revealed it at the time of the conference in March, Signal’s encryption protocol had been integrated into WhatsApp, the world’s most popular messaging app, with over a billion users.

“I think law enforce­ment should be difficult. And it should actually be possible to break the law.”

For any cypherpunk with an FBI file, it’s already an interesting morning. At the very moment the Cryptographers’ Panel takes the stage, Apple and the FBI are at the height of a six-week battle, arguing in front of the House Judiciary Commit­tee over the FBI’s demand that Apple help it access an encrypted ­iPhone 5c owned by San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook. Before that hearing ends, Apple’s general counsel will argue that doing so would set a dangerous legal precedent, inviting foreign govern­ments to make similar demands, and that the crypto-cracking software could be co-opted by criminals or spies.

The standoff quickly becomes the topic of the RSA panel, and Marlinspike waits politely for his turn to speak. Then he makes a far simpler and more radical argument than any advanced by Apple: Perhaps law enforcement shouldn’t be omniscient. “They already have a tremendous amount of information,” he tells the packed ballroom. He points out that the FBI had accessed Farook’s call logs as well as an older phone backup. “What the FBI seems to be saying is that we need this because we might be missing something. Obliquely, they’re asking us to take steps toward a world where that isn’t possible. And I don’t know if that’s the world we want to live in.”

Marlinspike follows this remark with a statement that practically no one else in the privacy community is willing to make in public: that yes, people will use encryption to do illegal things. And that may just be the whole point. “I actually think that law enforcement should be difficult,” Marlinspike says, looking calmly out at the crowd. “And I think it should actually be possible to break the law.”

Over the past several years, Marlinspike has quietly positioned himself at the front lines of a quarter-century-long war between advocates of encryption and law enforcement. Since the first strong encryption tools became publicly available in the early ’90s, the government has warned of the threat posed by “going dark”—that such software would cripple American police departments and intelligence agencies, allowing terrorists and organized criminals to operate with impunity. In 1993 it unsuccessfully tried to implement a backdoor system called the Clipper Chip to get around encryption. In 2013, Edward Snowden’s leaks revealed that the NSA had secretly sabotaged a widely used crypto standard in the mid- 2000s and that since 2007 the agency had been ingesting a smorgasbord of tech firms’ data with and without their cooperation. Apple’s battle with the FBI over Farook’s iPhone destroyed any pretense of a truce.

As the crypto war once again intensifies, Signal and its core protocol have emerged as darlings of the privacy community. Johns Hopkins computer science professor Matthew Green recalls that the first time he audited Marlinspike’s code, he was so impressed that he “literally discovered a line of drool running down my face.”

Marlinspike has enabled the largest end-to-end encrypted communications network in history.

While Marlinspike may present himself as an eccentric outsider, his ability to write freakishly secure software has aligned him with some of the tech industry’s biggest companies. For a time he led Twitter’s security team. His deal with WhatsApp means that the Facebook-owned company now uses his tools to encrypt every message, image, video, and voice call that travels over its global network; in effect Marlinspike has enabled the largest end-to-end encrypted communications network in history, transmitting more texts than every phone company in the world combined. In May, Google revealed that it too would integrate Signal—into the incognito mode of its messaging app Allo. And last month, Facebook Messenger began its own rollout of the protocol in an encryption feature called “secret conversations,” which promises to bring Signal to hundreds of millions more users. “The entire world is making this the standard for encrypted messaging,” Green says.

So far, governments aren’t having much luck pushing back. In March, Brazilian police briefly jailed a Facebook exec after WhatsApp failed to comply with a surveillance order in a drug investigation. The same month, The New York Times revealed that WhatsApp had received a wiretap order from the US Justice Department. The company couldn’t have complied in either case, even if it wanted to. Marlin­spike’s crypto is designed to scramble communications in such a way that no one but the people on either end of the conversation can decrypt them (see sidebar). “Moxie has brought us a world-class, state-of-the-art, end-to-end encryption system,” WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton says. “I want to emphasize: world-class.”

For Marlinspike, a failed wiretap can mean a small victory. A few days after Snowden’s first leaks, Marlin­spike posted an essay to his blog titled “We Should All Have Something to Hide,” emphasizing that privacy allows people to experi­ment with lawbreaking as a precursor for social progress. “Imagine if there were an alternate dystopian reality where law enforcement was 100 percent effective, such that any potential offenders knew they would be immediately identified, apprehended, and jailed,” he wrote. “How could people have decided that marijuana should be legal, if nobody had ever used it? How could states decide that same-sex marriage should be permitted?”

To some, Marlinspike’s logic isn’t quite as airtight as his code. Not all criminals are tech masterminds.

He admits that dangerous criminals and terrorists may use apps like Signal and WhatsApp. (ISIS has even circulated a manual recommending Signal.) But he argues that those elements have always had the incentive and ability to encrypt their communications with tougher-to-use tools like the encryption software PGP. His work, he says, is to make those protections possible for the average person without much tech savvy.

To some, Marlinspike’s logic isn’t quite as airtight as his code. Not all criminals are tech masterminds—the San Bernardino killers, for example. Former NSA attorney and Brookings Institution fellow Susan Hennessey wonders who determines which lawbreakers deserve to be wiretapped, if not a democratically elected government? Americans have long agreed, she argues, to enable a certain degree of police surveillance to prevent truly abhorrent crimes like child pornography, human trafficking, and terrorism. “We could set up our laws to reject surveillance outright, but we haven’t,” she says. “We’ve made a collective agreement that we derive value from some degree of government intru­sion.” A spokesman for the FBI, when asked to comment on Marlinspike’s law-breaking philosophy, replied, “The First Amendment protects people who hold whatever view they want. Some people are members of the KKK. I’m not going to engage in a debate with him.”

Marlinspike isn’t particularly interested in a debate, either; his mind was made up long ago, during years as an anarchist living on the fringes of society. “From very early in my life I’ve had this idea that the cops can do whatever they want, that they’re not on your team,” Marlinspike told me. “That they’re an armed, racist gang.”

Marlinspike views encryption as a preventative measure against a slide toward Orwellian fascism that makes protest and civil disobedience impossible, a threat he traces as far back as J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI wiretapping and blackmailing of Martin Luther King Jr. “Moxie is compelled by the troublemakers of history and their stories,” says Tyler Rein­hard, a designer who worked on Signal. “He sees encryption tools not as taking on the state directly but making sure that there’s still room for people to have those stories.”

Ask Marlinspike to tell his own story, and—no surprise for a privacy zealot—he’ll often answer with diversions, mono­syllables, and guarded smiles. But anyone who’s crossed paths with him seems to have an outsize anecdote: how he once biked across San Francisco carrying a 40-foot-tall sailboat mast. The time he decided to teach himself to pilot a hot-air balloon, bought a used one from Craigslist, and spent a month on crutches after crashing it in the desert. One friend swears he’s seen Marlinspike play high-stakes rock-paper-scissors dozens of times—with bets of hundreds of dollars or many hours of his time on the line—and has never seen him lose.

But before Marlinspike was a subcultural contender for “most interesting man in the world,” he was a kid growing up with a different and far less interesting name on his birth certificate, somewhere in a region of central Georgia that he describes as “one big strip mall.” His parents—who called him Moxie as a nickname—separated early on. He lived mostly with his mother, a secretary and paralegal at a string of companies. Any other family details, like his real name, are among the personal subjects he prefers not to comment on.

Marlinspike hated the curiosity-killing drudgery of school. But he had the idea to try programming videogames on an Apple II in the school library. The computer had a Basic interpreter but no hard drive or even a floppy disk to save his code. Instead, he’d retype simple programs again and again from scratch with every reboot, copying in commands from manuals to make shapes fill the screen. Browsing the computer section of a local bookstore, the preteen Marlin­spike found a copy of 2600 magazine, the catechism of the ’90s hacker scene. After his mother bought a cheap desk­top computer with a modem, he used it to trawl bulletin board services, root friends’ computers to make messages appear on their screens, and run a “war-dialer” program overnight, reaching out to distant servers at random.

“Moxie likes the idea that there is an unknown, that the world is not a com­pletely surveilled thing.”

To a bored middle schooler, it was all a revelation. “You look around and things don’t feel right, but you’ve never been anywhere else and you don’t know what you’re missing,” Marlin­spike says. “The Internet felt like a secret world hidden within this one.”

By his teens, Marlinspike was working after school for a German software company, writing developer tools. After graduating high school—barely—he headed to Silicon Valley in 1999. “I thought it would be like a William Gibson novel,” he says. “Instead it was just office parks and highways.” Jobless and homeless, he spent his first nights in San Francisco sleeping in Alamo Square Park beside his desktop computer.

Eventually, Marlinspike found a programming job at BEA-owned Web­Logic. But almost as soon as he’d broken in to the tech industry, he wanted out, bored by the routine of spending 40 hours a week in front of a keyboard. “I thought, ‘I’m supposed to do this every day for the rest of my life?’” he recalls. “I got interested in experimenting with a way to live that didn’t involve working.”

For the next few years, Marlinspike settled into a Bay Area scene that was, if not cyberpunk, at least punk. He started squatting in abandoned buildings with friends, eventually moving into an old postal service warehouse. He began bumming rides to political protests around the country and uploading free audio books to the web of himself reading anarchist theorists like Emma Goldman.

He took up hitchhiking, then he upgraded his wanderlust to hopping freight trains. And in 2003 he spontaneously decided to learn to sail. He spent a few hundred dollars—all the money he had—on a beat-up 27-foot Catalina and rashly set out alone from San Francisco’s harbor for Mexico, teaching himself by trial and error along the way. The next year, Marlin­spike filmed his own DIY sailing documentary, called Hold Fast. It follows his journey with three friends as they navigate a rehabilitated, leaky sloop called the Pestilence from Florida to the Bahamas, finally ditching the boat in the Dominican Republic.

Even today, Marlinspike describes those reckless adven­tures in the itinerant underground as a kind of peak in his life. “Looking back, I and everyone I knew was looking for that secret world hidden in this one,” he says, repeating the same phrase he’d used to describe the early Internet. “I think we were already there.”

If anything can explain Marlinspike’s impulse for privacy, it may be that time spent off society’s grid: a set of experi­ences that have driven him to protect a less observed way of life. “I think he likes the idea that there is an unknown,” says Trevor Perrin, a security engineer who helped Marlinspike design Signal’s core protocol. “That the world is not a completely surveilled thing.”

The Keys to Privacy

Beneath its ultrasimple interface, Moxie Marlinspike’s crypto protocol hides a Rube Goldberg machine of automated moving parts. Here’s how it works.

1. When Alice installs an app that uses Marlinspike’s protocol, it generates pairs of numeric sequences known as keys. With each pair, one sequence, known as a public key, will be sent to the app’s server and shared with her contacts. The other, called a private key, is stored on Alice’s phone and is never shared with anyone. The first pair of keys serves as an identity for Alice and never changes. Subsequent pairs will be generated with each message or voice call, and these temporary keys won’t be saved.

2. When Alice contacts her friend Bob, the app combines their public and private keys—both their identity keys and the temporary ones generated for a new message or voice call—to create a secret shared key. The shared key is then used to encrypt and decrypt their messages or calls.

3. The secret shared key changes with each message or call, and old shared keys aren’t stored. That means an eavesdropper who is recording their messages can’t decrypt their older communications even if that spy hacks one of their devices. (Alice and Bob should also periodically delete their message history.)

4. To make sure she’s communicating with Bob and not an impostor, Alice can check Bob’s fingerprint, a shortened version of his public identity key. If that key changes, either because someone is impersonating Bob in a so-called man-in-the-middle attack or simply because he ­reinstalled the app, Alice’s app will display a warning.

Through those years, Marlinspike took for granted that authority was the enemy. He describes harbor patrols and train yard guards who harassed him and his fellow hobo voyagers. Cops evicted him from squats, hassled him in the towns he and his friends passed through, and impounded their car on what seemed to be thin pretenses. But merely going to demonstrations never felt like the right way to challenge the world’s power structures.

Instead, around 2007 he turned his political interests back to the digital world, where he’d seen a slow shift toward post–Patriot Act surveillance. “When I was young, there was something fun about the insecurity of the Internet,” he says, with its bounty of hackable flaws available to benign prank­sters. “Now Internet insecurity is used by people I don’t like against people I do: the government against the people.”

In 2008, Marlinspike settled in a decrepit brick mansion in Pittsburgh and started churning out a torrent of security software. The next year he appeared for the first time at the Black Hat security conference to demonstrate a program he called SSLstrip, which exposed a critical flaw in web encryption. In 2010 he debuted GoogleSharing, a Firefox plugin that let anyone use ­Google services anonymously.

That year, with the growth of smartphones, Marlin­spike saw his biggest opportunity yet: to secure mobile communica­tions. Helped by a friend who was getting a robotics PhD at Carnegie Mellon, he launched Whisper Systems, along with a pair of Android apps: Text­Secure, to encrypt text messages, and RedPhone, to protect voice calls. Anti-­authoritarian ideals were built in from the beginning; when the Arab Spring exploded across North Africa, Whisper Systems was ready with an Arabic version to aid protesters.

Alone in the dark, Marlin­spike clung to the hull and realized, with slow and lonely certainty, that he was very likely going to die.

Marlinspike dreamed of bringing his encryption tools to millions of people, an ambition that required some sort of business model to fund them. He moved back to San Francisco to promote Whisper Systems as a for-profit startup. The company had barely gotten off the ground when Twitter approached him with a buyout offer, hoping to use his expertise to fix the shambolic security that had led to repeated hacks of celebrity and journalist accounts. The terms of the resulting deal were never made public. Marlin­spike describes it only as “more money than I’d ever encountered before. But that’s a low bar.”

Marlinspike became the director of product security at Twitter. A coworker remembers that his expertise was “revered” within the company. But his greater goal was to alter the platform so that it didn’t keep logs of users’ IP addresses, which would make it impossible for authorities to demand someone’s identity, as they’d done with one Occupy Wall Street protester in 2012.

That project clashed with the priorities of executives, a coworker says. “Moxie couldn’t care less if Twitter made a lot of money,” the former colleague says. “He was more interested in protecting users.” Meanwhile, his contract stipulated that he’d have to work for four years before cashing out the stock he’d been paid for his startup. Marlinspike’s cypherpunk apotheosis would have to wait.

One fall evening after work, Marlinspike and a friend made a simple plan to sail a 15-foot catamaran out 600 feet into the San Francisco Bay, where they’d drop anchor and row back in a smaller boat, leaving the sailboat to wait for their next adventure. (Anarchist sailors don’t like to pay dockage fees.) Marlinspike headed out into the bay on the catamaran with his friend following in a rowboat.

Only after Marlinspike had passed the pier did he realize the wind was blowing at a treacherous 30 miles an hour. He decided to turn back but discovered that he’d misrigged the craft and had to fix his mistake. As the sun sank toward the horizon, he shouted to his friend that they should give up and return to shore, and the friend rowed back to safety.

Then, without warning, the wind gusted. The catamaran flipped, throwing Marlinspike into the ice-cold water. “The suddenness of it was unbelievable, as if I was on a tiny model made of paper which someone had simply flicked with their finger,” he would later write in a blog post about the experience.

Soon the boat was fully upside down, pinned in place by the wind. Marlinspike tried to swim for shore. But the pier was too far away, the waves too strong, and he could feel his body succumbing to hypothermia, blackness creeping into the edges of his vision. He headed back to the overturned boat. Alone now in the dark, he clung to the hull, took stock of the last hour’s events, and realized, with slow and lonely certainty, that he was very likely going to die.

When a tugboat finally chanced upon his soaked and frozen form he was nearly unconscious and had to be towed up with a rope. When he arrived at the hospital, Marlinspike says, the nurses told him his temperature was so low their digital thermometers couldn’t register it. As he recovered over the next days, he had the sort of realization that sometimes results from a near-death experience. “It definitely sharpened my focus,” he says of the incident. “It made me question what I was doing with my life.”

Marlinspike’s time at Twitter had given him an ambitious sense of scale: He was determined to encrypt core chunks of the Internet.

A normal person might have quit sailing. Instead, Marlinspike quit Twitter. A year and a day after he had started, he walked away from over $1 million in company stock.

Marlinspike quickly picked up where he’d left off. In early 2013 he relaunched his startup as an open source project called Open Whisper Systems. To fund it, he turned to Dan Meredith, director of the Open Technology Fund, a group supported by the Broad­casting Board of Governors, best known for running Radio Free Europe. Meredith had long admired Marlinspike’s encryption apps. As a former security tech at Al Jazeera, he had relied on them to protect reporters and sources during the Arab Spring. “They were what our most sensitive sources used,” Meredith says. “I knew Moxie could do this, and we had the money to make it possible.” The OTF gave Open Whisper Systems around $500,000 in its first year and in total has funneled close to $2.3 million to the group.

With that funding and more from wealthy donors that Marlinspike declines to name, he began recruiting devel­opers and hosting them at periodic retreats in Hawaii, where they’d alternate surfing and coding. In quick succession, Open Whisper Systems released Signal and then versions for Android and the Chrome browser. (Open Whisper Systems has since integrated changes from dozens of open source contributors but still uses the same cryptographic skeleton laid out by Marlinspike and Trevor Perrin in 2013.)

Marlinspike’s time at Twitter had given him an ambitious sense of scale: He was determined to encrypt core chunks of the Internet, not just its fringes. By chance, he met a Whats­App engineer at a family reunion his girlfriend at the time threw at his house. Through that connection, Marlinspike wangled a meeting with WhatsApp’s cofounder Brian Acton. Later, Marlinspike met with the company’s other cofounder, Jan Koum, who had grown up in Soviet Ukraine under the constant threat of KGB eavesdropping.

Both men were almost immediately interested in using Marlinspike’s protocols to protect WhatsApp’s international users, particularly its massive user bases in privacy-loving Germany and surveillance regimes in the Middle East and South America. “We were aligned pretty early,” Acton says. “When we got past the hairstyle, we were like, ‘Let’s get down to business.’”

In a hotel room above San Francisco’s Soma district a few hours after his RSA panel, Marlinspike pulls out a slim laptop and enters his password to decrypt its hard drive. Or rather, attempts to; the string of characters is so long and complex that he mistypes it three times and, with a slightly embarrassed grin, has to reboot the computer. Finally he succeeds and opens a video file. It’s a rough cut of an ad for Signal he’s hoping to spread online, a montage of footage of the Russian punk protest band Pussy Riot, Daniel Ellsberg, Jesse Owens, Hong Kong’s pro-­democracy Umbrella protesters, and Martin Luther King Jr. “They tell us to stay quiet and follow the rules,” a rough voice intones over the images. “We believe in the power of your words … Speak up, send a message.”

Marlinspike’s intention with the spot, whose script he wrote, was to create a “Nike ad for privacy,” he says. “Nike has a boring product. They don’t talk about the shoes. They celebrate great athletes. We’re trying to do the same thing, celebrating people with a contestational relationship to power. Activists, whistle-blowers, journalists, artists.”

“The big win is when a billion people are using WhatsApp and don’t even know it’s encrypted. I think we’ve already won the future.”

Today, those people include Edward Snowden, who has written that he uses Signal “every day.” (Marlinspike recently visited the exiled whistle-blower in Moscow.) Laura Poitras, the Pulitzer- and Oscar-­winning recipient of Snowden’s NSA leaks, recommends it to docu­mentary filmmakers and journalists. Women’s rights activists in Latin America who help women find abortions use Signal. So do North Korean defectors evading Kim Jong-un’s spies. Attorneys at the National Lawyers Guild use it to speak about clients. Members of Hands Up United, one of the groups leading the Black Lives Matter movement in Ferguson, Missouri, two years ago, started using Signal after noticing police cars following them home or parked outside of their meetings and strange tones and dropped calls on their cell phones. (The Intercept revealed last summer that the Department of Homeland Security monitored the protesters.) “Signal gave us so much confidence to continue our work,” says Hands Up United organizer Idalin Bobé.

But these are only the early adopters in Marlinspike’s master plan. He outlines his endgame: In the past, government-friendly phone companies have practically partnered with law enforcement to make wiretaps easy. Now people are increasingly shifting to what he calls overlay services—apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger—to communicate. And that switch offers a chance to start fresh, with a communications infrastructure that can be built to resist surveillance. “The big win for us is when a billion people are using WhatsApp and they don’t even know it’s encrypted,” Marlinspike says. “At this point, I think we’ve already won the future.”

The next day, Marlinspike is rushing over to Open Whisper Systems headquarters, where he’s late for a meeting. As I speed-walk to keep up with his long legs, he grouses about the day-to-day of running a software project: the bug reports and constant tweaks to keep up with operating systems’ improvements, the deadening hours of sitting in front of a computer.

Marlinspike surprises me by admitting that he looks forward to the moment when he can quit. “Someday Signal will fade away,” he states unsentimentally. Instead, he says, Open Whisper System’s legacy will be the changes Signal will have inspired in better-funded, for-profit communi­cation apps.

That time may not be so far off. “I don’t really want to do this with the rest of my life,” Marlin­spike says. “Eventually, you have to declare victory.”

But cypherpunks like Marlinspike—let’s be honest—haven’t yet won the crypto war. In fact, the war may be unwinnable by either side. If the rise of end-to-end encrypted messaging enables the sort of benign law breaking Marlinspike has preached, sooner or later it will also shield some indefen­sible crimes. And that means every technological move toward privacy will be answered with a legal one aimed at shifting the equilibrium back toward surveillance: If law enforcement continues to be foiled by uncrackable encryption, it will come back with an order for “technical assistance,” demanding companies weaken their security measures and rewrite their code to help the cops, as the FBI demanded of Apple. Some form of crypto backdoor might even be built in secret. And Congress still threatens to advance legislation that could ban user-­controlled encryption outright.

But these legal and political battles may not be Marlin­spike’s to fight. “He definitely romanticizes being an amateur,” says one particularly frank friend. “He likes to give up once he’s an expert.” Marlinspike, she says, seeks the “zero point, when you have nothing to lose, when you have no property, no lover, nothing to hold you back.”

Cypherpunks like Marlin­spike haven’t yet won the crypto war. In fact, the war may be unwinnable by either side.

I’m reminded of that underlying restlessness on the last evening I spend with Marlinspike, at a Sunday night screening of Hold Fast, hosted by a sailing club at the Berkeley Marina. As his doc plays to a crowd of a few dozen people, we sit in the back next to a wood-burning stove, with a spring storm churning the bay outside the window behind us.

Early in the film, the narration goes off on a tangent, telling the story of Bernard Moitessier, whom Marlinspike describes reverentially as a sailing mystic. In 1969, Moites­sier was winning the Golden Globe, a solo, globe-circling yacht race. Moitessier, a monklike eccentric, didn’t even carry a radio, instead using a slingshot to hurl film canisters containing messages to nearby ships. Just as Moitessier was set to finish ahead of his competitors in Plymouth, England, he shot off a message rejecting the competition and explaining that he would rather simply keep sailing for the Pacific Islands. “I am continuing nonstop because I am happy at sea,” the note read, “and perhaps because I want to save my soul.”

When the screening ends, the lights come up and Marlin­spike takes questions. A middle-aged woman asks him what he’s doing now, nine years after the film’s release. Along with plenty of other people in this audience, she knows him only as Moxie Marlinspike the rogue sailor, not as a cryptographer.

Marlinspike takes a second to think, as if he’s never actually considered the question before. “I don’t know,” he says finally, sighing with what sounds like sincere uncertainty. “Maybe I should go back to sailing cheap.”

The crowd laughs at Marlinspike’s show of self-effacing confusion. But he seems to mean what he says. And over their heads, out the window, past the bay, lies the Pacific Ocean: dark, unknown, and inviting.

This article appears in the August issue.
Computers are getting better at spotting trolls, but they often can’t understand the meaning of messages.

Trolls seem to lurk in every corner of the Internet, and they delight in ruining your day. But if our e-mail inboxes can be kept relatively spam-free, why can’t machines automatically purge abusive messages from tweets or comments?

It’s a question that seems relevant to the very fabric of Internet culture today. Last week, Twitter banned a journalist that it accused of orchestrating a campaign of abuse aimed at one of the stars of the all-female Ghostbusters reboot. Twitter said it would introduce new guidelines and tools for reporting abuse through its service. Certainly, countless other incidents on Twitter and elsewhere go unnoticed every day.

Researchers are, in fact, making some progress toward technology that can help stop the abuse. A team at Yahoo recently developed an algorithm capable of catching abusive messages better than any other automated system to date. The researchers created a data set of abuse by collecting messages on Yahoo articles that were flagged as offensive by the company’s own comment editors.

The Yahoo team used a number of conventional techniques, including looking for abusive keywords, punctuation that often seemed to accompany abusive messages, and syntactic clues as to the meaning of a sentence.

But the researchers also applied a more advanced approach to automated language understanding, using a way of representing the meaning of words as vectors with many dimensions. This approach, known as “word embedding,” allows semantics to be processed in a sophisticated way. For instance, even if a comment contains a string of words that have not been identified as abusive, the representations of that string in vector space may be enough to identify it as such.

When everything was combined, the team was able to identify abusive messages (from its own data set) with roughly 90 percent accuracy.

Catching the remaining 10 percent may prove tricky. Although AI researchers are making significant progress in training machines to parse language, artificial intelligence has yet to equip computers with the brainpower needed to untangle meaning. As a contest held at a recent AI conference shows, computers cannot disentangle the most simple ambiguities in sentences.

Many tech companies, including Twitter, have AI researchers dedicated to advancing the state of the art in areas such as image recognition and text comprehension. But so far surprisingly little effort seems to have been put into catching abuse or harassment systematically. Twitter declined to say if its AI team is actively working on the problem (although it seems likely). But it is unlikely that the company will introduce a magic bullet for filtering out malicious messages. The problem with automated hate filtering is that words are packed with meaning that can only be unpacked with real intelligence.

“Automatically identifying abuse is surprisingly difficult,” says Alex Krasodomski-Jones, who tracks online abuse as a researcher with the U.K.-based Centre for Analysis of Social Media. “The language of abuse is amorphous—changing frequently and often used in ways that do not connote abuse, such as when racially or sexually charged terms are appropriated by the groups they once denigrated. Given 10 tweets, a group of humans will rarely all agree on which ones should be classed as abusive, so you can imagine how difficult it would be for a computer.”

Until machines gain real intelligence, filtering out hateful messages will be impossible. But Krasodomski-Jones offers another, more human, reason why we might not want an automated solution: “In a world where what we read is increasingly dictated by algorithms and filters, we ought to be careful about demanding more computer interference.”
Talking toys have come a long way since the original Furby. Now they’re connected to the Internet, use speech recognition, and are raising a host of new questions about the online privacy and security of children.

Hackers have already targeted toys. Late last year, Hong Kong-based digital toy maker Vtech admitted that cybercriminals accessed the personal information of 6.4 million children. Researchers have also shown how hackers can gain control of connected dolls. But a number of the privacy-related challenges raised by connected toys are novel. They are collecting new kinds of data, and what’s at stake if something goes wrong is not always clear.

Two of the most prominent examples of the new generation of toys are the Dino, a cloud-connected, Wi-Fi-enabled plastic dinosaur that uses speech recognition technology and IBM’s Watson to “listen” and respond to a child’s words, and Mattel’s Hello Barbie, which also uses speech recognition and uploads voice recordings to the cloud. Both work in way that’s similar to the way virtual assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa work.

They’re regulated by a law that now looks outdated. In 1998, the U.S. enacted the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, to protect young children from the risks of sharing personal information online. The Federal Trade Commission enforces COPPA, which is designed to give parents control over their children’s data. But some privacy advocates and policymakers argue that COPPA is not clear enough in some cases, given the wide and growing range of technological capabilities of today’s toys.

The Dino, made by a startup called Elemental Path, records what children say and uses IBM’s Watson to respond.

Technically, COPPA applies to online services “directed to children under 13 that collect, use, or disclose personal information from children.” That clearly includes toys like the Dino and Hello Barbie. But should it also apply to other applications like Siri and Alexa, or other data-collecting online services that are popular with children even though they are not exclusively directed at them?

Earlier this month, Virginia Senator Mark Warner sent a letter to the FTC expressing concern over the increasing collection of children’s personal information by apps and toys, and to ask for clarification about how the FTC will enforce COPPA in this environment. “While Congress may have had an inkling of the future growth of web-services in 1998,” Warner wrote, “it certainly did not envision the array of conventional household products that now possess data gathering and processing capabilities.” He asked the commission to clarify how it determines whether a device, website, or app is directed at children. The FTC has not yet responded.

Another set of big questions hovers around consent. Under COPPA, companies must get “verified consent” from a child’s parent before collecting personal information from that child. But getting that consent for connected toys can be much trickier than when Internet just meant browsers and websites.

One of the biggest challenges is that new connected toys and devices often feature small, limited, or disconnected user interfaces, if they have them at all, former FTC commissioner Julie Brill said at a discussion this week in Washington, D.C., focused on children’s online privacy. Brill, now a partner at a D.C. law firm, served as an FTC commissioner from 2010 until last March.

The Dino and Hello Barbie come with applications that parents can use to adjust settings and provide consent to data collection. But what happens when another child comes over, or the child takes the toy to school? Technically it can’t record other children until their own parents give consent as well, said Brill. This will be an “interesting challenge,” and companies will have to come up with creative new ways to get this consent, she said. For example, future products may be able to use voice recognition—not just speech recognition—to identify specific people and refrain from recording those who have not consented.

Finally, thorny ethical dilemmas could arise, especially if young children choose to share very sensitive things. What exactly should a company do when it records a four-year-old saying she’s been abused? Notify the police? What if it’s not true? Questions like these are challenging, but as connected toys and other listening devices become more popular we’ll probably need to answer them.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Charles Joseph Whitman (June 24, 1941 – August 1, 1966) was an American engineering student at the University of Texas and mass murderer who gunned down 49 people, killing 16.

In the early morning hours of August 1, 1966, Whitman murdered his wife and his mother in their homes. Later that day, he brought a number of guns, including rifles, a shotgun, and handguns, to the campus of the University of Texas at Austin where, over an approximate 90- to 95-minute period, he killed 14 people and wounded 32 others in a mass shooting in and around the Tower. Whitman shot and killed three people inside the university's tower and eleven others after firing at random from the 28th-floor observation deck of the Main Building. Whitman was eventually shot and killed by Austin police officer Houston McCoy.[2][3][4][5]

Early life and education [ edit ]

Charles Joseph Whitman was born on June 24, 1941, in Lake Worth, Florida, the eldest of three sons born to Margaret E. (Hodges) and Charles Adolphus "C. A." Whitman, Jr.[6] Whitman's father had been raised in an orphanage in Savannah, Georgia,[7] and described himself as a self-made man. In 1940, he had married Margaret, then 17 years old. The marriage of Whitman's parents was marred by domestic violence: Whitman's father was an admitted authoritarian who provided for his family but demanded near perfection from all of them. He was known to physically and emotionally abuse his wife and children.[8]

As a boy, Whitman was described as a polite, well-mannered child who seldom lost his temper.[9] He was extremely intelligent: an examination at the age of six revealed his IQ to be 139.[10] Whitman's academic achievements were encouraged by his parents, yet any indication of failure or a lethargic attitude would be met with discipline—often physical—from his father.[11]

Margaret Whitman was a devout Roman Catholic who raised her sons in the same faith. The Whitman brothers regularly attended Mass with their mother, and all three brothers served as altar boys at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church.[12]

Whitman Sr. was a firearms collector and enthusiast, who taught each of his sons from an early age how to shoot, clean, and maintain weapons. He regularly took them on hunting trips, and Charles became an avid hunter and accomplished marksman. His father said of him: "Charlie could plug the eye out of a squirrel by the time he was sixteen."[13]

At the age of 11, Whitman joined the Boy Scouts and earned a total of 21 merit badges in 15 months.[10] On September 15, 1953, at the age of 12 years and three months, Whitman also earned the rank of Eagle Scout in Troop 119 in Lake Worth. Whitman was reportedly the youngest person in the world ever to become an Eagle Scout at that time.[7][8] Whitman also became an accomplished pianist at the age of 12.[14] At around the same time, he undertook an extensive newspaper route, delivering the Miami Herald in and around his neighborhood. As he had many households to cover, on occasions, his parents used their car to assist their son on his route – particularly in bad weather.[15]

High school [ edit ]

Whitman around 1959 (age 18)

On September 1, 1955, Whitman entered St. Ann's High School in West Palm Beach, where he was regarded as a moderately popular student whose intelligence was noted by teachers and his peers alike.[16] By the next month, he had saved enough money from his newspaper route to purchase a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which he used on his route.[17]

At the age of 16, Whitman underwent a routine appendectomy and was hospitalized following a motorcycle accident.[18] In February 1958, Whitman was hospitalized for surgery to remove a blood clot which had formed around his left testicle.[19] Whitman missed a total of 16 school days.[20]

One month after his June 1959 graduation from high school (where he had graduated seventh in a class of 72 students),[7] Whitman enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He had not told his father beforehand. Whitman told a family friend that the catalyst was an incident a month before. His father had beaten him and thrown him into the family swimming pool, almost drowning him, because Whitman had come home drunk after an evening socializing with friends.[8] Whitman left home on July 6, having been assigned an 18-month tour of duty with the Marines at Guantanamo Bay. His father still did not know he had enlisted.[7]

As Whitman traveled toward Parris Island, his father learned of his action and telephoned a branch of the federal government, trying unsuccessfully to have his son's enlistment canceled.[12]

U.S. Marine and college student [ edit ]

During Whitman's initial 18-month service in 1959 and 1960, he earned a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, a Sharpshooter's Badge, and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal. Whitman received 215 out of 250 possible points on marksmanship tests, and did well when shooting rapidly over long distances and aiming at moving targets. After completing his assignment, Whitman applied to a U.S. Navy and Marine Corps scholarship program, intending to complete college and become a commissioned officer.[21]

Whitman earned high scores on the required examination, and the selection committee approved his enrollment at a preparatory school in Maryland. Whitman successfully completed courses in mathematics and physics before being approved to transfer to the University of Texas at Austin to study mechanical engineering.[21]

University life [ edit ]

Whitman entered the mechanical engineering program at the University of Texas at Austin on September 15, 1961. Whitman was initially a poor student whose grades were largely unimpressive. His hobbies included karate, scuba diving, gambling, and hunting.[22] Shortly after his enrollment at the university, two friends and he were observed poaching a deer; a passer-by noted Whitman's license plate number and reported them to police. The trio were butchering the deer in the shower at Whitman's dormitory when they were arrested.[12] Whitman was fined $100 ($800 today) for the offense.[23]

Whitman earned a reputation as a practical joker in his years as an engineering student, but his friends also noted he made some morbid and chilling statements. On one occasion in 1962, as a fellow student named Francis Schuck, Jr., and he browsed the bookstore in the Main Building of the University of Texas, Whitman remarked, "A person could stand off an army from atop of it [the tower] before they got him."[24]

Marriage [ edit ]

In February 1962, 20-year-old Whitman met Kathleen Frances Leissner, an education major two years his junior. Leissner was Whitman's first serious girlfriend. They courted for five months before announcing their engagement on July 19.[25]

On August 17, 1962, Whitman and Leissner were married in a Catholic ceremony held in Leissner's hometown of Needville, Texas.[26] The couple chose the 22nd wedding anniversary of Whitman's parents as the date for their wedding.[24] Whitman's family drove from Florida to Texas to attend the event, and his younger brother Patrick served as best man. Fr. Leduc, a Whitman family friend, presided over the ceremony. Leissner's family and friends approved of her choice of husband, describing Whitman as a "handsome young man."[27]

Although Whitman's grades improved somewhat during his second and third semesters at the University of Texas at Austin, the Marine Corps considered his academic performance unacceptable in support of his scholarship. Whitman was ordered to active duty in February 1963.[28] Whitman went to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, to serve the remainder of his five-year enlistment.[29]

Camp Lejeune [ edit ]

Whitman apparently resented his college studies being ended, although he was automatically promoted to the rank of lance corporal. On one occasion at Camp Lejeune, Whitman and two other Marines were involved in an accident in which their Jeep rolled over an embankment. Whitman single-handedly lifted the vehicle to free another Marine,[30] but fell to the ground unconscious from the effort. He was hospitalized for four days.[18]

Whitman had a reputation as an exemplary Marine, but he continued to gamble at Camp Lejeune. In November 1963, he was court-martialed for gambling, usury, possession of a personal firearm on base, and threatening another Marine over a $30 loan ($200 today), for which he had demanded $15 in interest. Sentenced to 30 days of confinement and 90 days of hard labor, he was demoted in rank from lance corporal (E-3) to private (E-1).[31]

Documented frustrations [ edit ]

Whitman's self-penned journal.

In 1963, as he awaited his court martial, Whitman began to write a diary titled "Daily Record of C.J. Whitman".[32] He covered his daily life in the Marine Corps and his interactions with Kathy and other family members. He also wrote about his upcoming court martial and contempt for the Marine Corps; he criticized them for inefficiencies. In his writings about his wife, Whitman often praised her, and wrote how he longed to be with her. He also wrote about his efforts and plans to free himself from financial dependence on his father.[33]

In December 1964, Whitman was honorably discharged from the Marines. He returned to the University of Texas at Austin, enrolling in the architectural engineering program. To support Kathy and himself, he worked as a bill collector for the Standard Finance Company. Later, he worked as a bank teller at the Austin National Bank. In January 1965, Whitman took a temporary job with Central Freight Lines as a traffic surveyor for the Texas Highway Department.[34][35] He also volunteered as a scout leader for Austin Scout Troop 5, as his wife Kathy now worked as a biology teacher at Lanier High School.[36]

Two close friends of Whitman, John and Fran Morgan, later told the Texas Department of Public Safety that he had told them about striking his wife on two occasions.[37] They said that Whitman despised himself for the behavior and confessed to being "mortally afraid of being like his father."[38] Whitman lamented his actions in his journal, and resolved to be a good husband and not abusive as his father had been.[39]

Separation of Whitman's parents [ edit ]

In May 1966, Margaret Whitman announced her decision to divorce Whitman's father due to his physical abuse.[40] Charles Whitman drove to Florida to help his mother move to Austin. Whitman was reportedly so afraid that his father would resort to violence against his mother as she prepared to leave, he summoned a local policeman to remain outside the house while his mother packed her belongings.[40] Whitman's youngest brother, John, also left Lake Worth and moved to Austin with his mother. Patrick Whitman, the middle son, remained in Florida and worked in his father's plumbing supply business.[41]

In Austin, Whitman's mother took a job in a cafeteria and moved into her own apartment, though she remained in close contact with him.[40] Whitman's father later said he had spent more than a thousand dollars on long-distance phone calls to both his wife and Charles, begging his wife to return and asking his son to convince her to come back.[40] During this stressful time, Whitman was abusing amphetamines and began experiencing severe headaches. He later described these as being "tremendous."[42]

On the eve of the shootings at the University Tower, Whitman wrote in his journal, reaffirming his love for his wife Kathy. His final entries were written in the past tense, suggesting he may have already killed his wife and mother.[43]

The murders [ edit ]

Wife and mother [ edit ]

The day before the shootings, Whitman bought a pair of binoculars and a knife from a hardware store, and some Spam from a 7-Eleven convenience store. He picked up his wife from her summer job as a telephone operator, before meeting his mother for lunch at the Wyatt Cafeteria, close to the university.[44]

At approximately 4:00 pm on July 31, 1966, Charles and Kathy Whitman visited their close friends John and Fran Morgan. They left the Morgans' apartment at 5:50 pm so Kathy could get to her 6:00–10:00 pm shift.[45]

At 6:45 pm, Whitman began typing his suicide note, a portion of which read:

"I do not quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts."[46]

Whitman wrote that he requested an autopsy be conducted upon his body, to determine if there was a biological reason for his actions and increasing headaches. He also wrote that he had decided to kill both his mother and wife. Expressing uncertainty about his reasons, he stated he wanted to relieve his wife and mother from the suffering of this world and to save them the embarrassment of his actions. He did not mention planning the attack at the university.[47]

Just after midnight on August 1, Whitman drove to his mother's apartment at 1212 Guadalupe Street. After killing his mother, he placed her body on her bed and covered it with sheets.[48] His method of murder is disputed, but officials believed he rendered her unconscious before stabbing her in the heart.[49]

He left a handwritten note beside her body, which read in part:

To Whom It May Concern: I have just taken my mother's life. I am very upset over having done it. However, I feel that if there is a heaven she is definitely there now [...] I am truly sorry [...] Let there be no doubt in your mind that I loved this woman with all my heart.[50]

Whitman then returned to his home at 906 Jewell Street, where he killed his wife by stabbing her three times in the heart as she slept. He covered her body with sheets, then resumed the typewritten note he had begun the previous evening.[51] Using a ballpoint pen, he wrote at the side of the page:

Friends interrupted. 8-1-66 Mon. 3:00 A.M. BOTH DEAD.[48]

Whitman continued the note, finishing it by pen:

I imagine it appears that I brutally killed both of my loved ones. I was only trying to do a quick thorough job [...] If my life insurance policy is valid please pay off my debts [...] donate the rest anonymously to a mental health foundation. Maybe research can prevent further tragedies of this type [...] Give our dog to my in-laws. Tell them Kathy loved "Schocie" very much [...] If you can find in yourselves to grant my last wish, cremate me after the autopsy.[46]

He also left instructions in the rented house requesting that two rolls of camera film be developed. Whitman also wrote personal notes to each of his brothers.[52]

Whitman last wrote on an envelope labeled, 'Thoughts For the Day,' in which he stored a collection of written admonitions. He added on the outside of the envelope:

8-1-66. I never could quite make it. These thoughts are too much for me.[48]

At 5:45 am on August 1, 1966, Whitman phoned his wife's supervisor at Bell System to explain that Kathy was ill and unable to work that day. He made a similar phone call to his mother's workplace five hours later.

Preparations for tower shootings [ edit ]

The rifles and sawed-off shotgun used by Whitman in the massacre

On the morning of August 1, Whitman rented a hand truck from Austin Rental Company and cashed $250 (equivalent to $1,823.33 in 2015) of worthless checks at the bank before driving to a hardware store, where he purchased a Universal M1 carbine, two additional ammunition magazines and eight boxes of ammunition, explaining to the cashier that he planned to hunt wild hogs.[53] Whitman then drove to Chuck's Gun Shop, where he purchased four further carbine magazines, six additional boxes of ammunition, and a can of gun cleaning solvent.[54] He then drove to Sears, where he purchased a Sears Model 60 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun before returning with his purchases to his home.[55]

Inside his garage, Whitman sawed off the barrel and butt stock of the 12-gauge shotgun, and packed into his footlocker the weapon, together with a Remington 700 6-mm bolt-action hunting rifle, a .35-caliber pump rifle, a .30-caliber carbine M1, a 9-mm Luger pistol, a Galesi-Brescia .25-caliber pistol, a Smith & Wesson M19 .357 Magnum revolver, and over 700 rounds of ammunition. He had already packed in it food, coffee, vitamins, Dexedrine, Excedrin, earplugs, jugs of water, matches, lighter fluid, rope, binoculars, a machete, three knives, a transistor radio, toilet paper, a razor, and a bottle of deodorant.[56] Before heading to the tower about 11:00 a.m., Whitman dressed in khaki coveralls over his shirt and jeans.[57]

Shooting begins [ edit ]

At approximately 11:35 am,[56] Whitman arrived on the University of Texas at Austin campus. Showing a security guard, Jack Rodman, false identification as a research assistant, he obtained a 40-minute parking permit, saying he was delivering equipment.[56] Whitman wheeled a rented dolly carrying his equipment toward the Main Building of the University.[58]

Entering the Main Building, Whitman tried to activate the elevator. Vera Palmer, an employee, said it had not been powered and turned it on for him. Whitman thanked her, saying: "You don't know how happy that makes me [...] how happy that makes me."[53] He then ascended to the 27th floor of the tower (the highest floor the elevator reached); just one floor beneath the clock face.[59]

Main building of the University of Texas at Austin from where Whitman fired upon those below from the observation deck

Whitman lugged the dolly and equipment up the final flight of stairs to the hallway that led to a dog-legged stairway ascending to the rooms within the observation deck area.[60] In the reception area, Whitman encountered 51-year-old receptionist Edna Townsley. Whitman knocked her to the floor and hit her in the head with his rifle butt, splitting the back of her skull. He then struck Townsley above the left eye, causing a second fracture, before dragging her body behind a couch.[61]

Moments later, an Austin couple named Cheryl Botts and Don Walden, who had been taking in the view from the observation deck, returned to the reception area. Whitman was leaning across the couch,[62] holding a rifle in each hand. Botts observed a dark stain on the floor beside the reception desk, and later said she believed it to be varnish. Walden himself thought Whitman was there to shoot pigeons. Whitman and the couple exchanged brief pleasantries before the couple left. Whitman then barricaded the stairway.[63]

As he prepared to enter the observation deck, he saw two families: M. J. Gabour, his wife Mary, their teenaged sons Mike and Mark, and the boys' aunt and uncle, Marguerite and William Lamport, ascending the stairs toward his makeshift barricade. Mary Gabour later recollected that her sons and she had thought the barricade was in place for cleaning the reception area and that Whitman—still donned in khaki overalls—was the janitor. As 16-year-old Mark Gabour and his 18-year-old brother Mike tried to look beyond the barricade and open the door, Whitman fired his shotgun at them, instantly killing Mark with shots to the head and neck. He shot Mike in the head, shoulder, and left leg, knocking him unconscious. Both brothers fell down the staircase in front of their family. Whitman fired the sawed-off shotgun three more times through grates, hitting and wounding Mary Gabour in the head and killing 56-year-old Marguerite Lamport with a shot to the chest.[64] Whitman then killed Edna Townsley with a shot to the left side of her head before walking onto the observation deck.[65] The tower has a vantage point 231 feet (70 m) above ground level.[66]

Shooting from the tower [ edit ]

The first shots fired by Whitman from the tower's outer deck came at approximately 11:48 am. He first hit Claire Wilson, an 18-year-old anthropology student who was eight months pregnant. Whitman shot Wilson in the abdomen, killing her unborn child. The shot dropped Wilson to the concrete on the mall as her fiancé, 18-year-old Thomas Eckman, asked her, "What's wrong?"[67] Whitman shot and killed Eckman as he tried to help Wilson. He next shot Robert Boyer, a 33-year-old mathematician, who was killed instantly by a single shot to the lower back.[68] After shooting Boyer, Whitman shot a 31-year-old student named Devereau Huffman in the right arm; Huffman fell wounded beside a hedge.[69] When Charlotte Darehshori, a young secretary, ran to help Boyer and Huffman, she came under fire. She crouched beneath the concrete base of a flagpole for an hour and a half, shielding herself from Whitman's view.[70] Nearby, Whitman shot David Gunby, a 23-year-old electrical engineering student walking in the courtyard.[71] Whitman fatally shot Thomas Ashton, a 22-year-old, in the chest.[72] Next, he shot Adrian and Brenda Littlefield as they walked onto the South Mall. Two young women, Nancy Harvey and Ellen Evganides, were wounded as they walked down the West Mall. Whitman shot Harvey, who was five-months pregnant, in the hip, and Evganides in the leg and thigh.[73] Both Harvey and her unborn child survived.

Whitman began to fire upon people walking on Guadalupe Street; he shot and wounded 17-year-old newspaper delivery boy Alex Hernandez, before fatally wounding 17-year-old Karen Griffith[74] with a shot to the shoulder and lung. The next victim was a 24-year-old senior named Thomas Karr, whom Whitman fatally shot in the back as he walked to his residence after completing an exam. On the third block, Whitman shot and wounded 35-year-old basketball coach Billy Snowden from a distance of over 1,500 feet (460 m). Nearby, he shot 21-year-old Sandra Wilson in the chest.[75]

On the corner of 24th and Guadalupe, Whitman shot and wounded two students, Abdul Khashab and his fiancee Janet Paulos, outside a dress shop. Khashab, a 26-year-old chemistry student from Iraq, was shot in the elbow and Paulos in the chest.[76] The next to be shot was a 21-year-old named Lana Phillips, whom Whitman wounded in the shoulder.[77] Phillips' sister ran from cover to drag Lana to safety.[78]

Three Peace Corps trainees, Tom Herman, Roland Ehlke and David Mattson, were Whitman's next targets. The trio were shot at as they walked toward a luncheon for volunteers. Mattson had part of his wrist blown off.[79] Ehlke subsequently recalled that he heard Mattson scream as the bullet hit him in the wrist; the youth saw shrapnel from the shot had embedded into his own left arm. Ehlke was shot in the left biceps before he dived for cover. Ehlke emerged from cover to drag his friend to safety and was shot again in the leg.[80] A 64-year-old local shopkeeper named Homer Kelly helped drag the wounded duo—plus Herman—into his shop, before he was shot and wounded in the leg.[81]

To the rear of the intersection of 24th and Guadalupe Street, Whitman targeted two 21-year-olds, Oscar Royuela and Irma Garcia, as the pair walked toward the university's biology laboratory. Shot first, Garcia later said the bullet spun her "completely around" and she fell to the ground. Royuela tried to help Garcia when he was shot through the shoulder blade; the bullet exited through his left arm.[82] Students Jack Stephens and Jack Pennington ran from cover and dragged the pair to safety. Whitman targeted a 26-year-old carpenter named Avelino Esparza and seriously wounded him in the left shoulder.[83]

Directly in front of the entrance to the West Mall on Guadalupe Street, two 18-year-old students named Paul Sonntag and Claudia Rutt had taken refuge behind a construction barricade alongside teenager Carla Sue Wheeler. Whitman started shooting in that direction and hit Sonntag in the mouth, killing him instantly. Sonntag's body fell against a parking meter and knocked the barricade slightly open.[84] Rutt tried to reach Sonntag while Wheeler restrained her; Whitman shot a bullet that passed through Wheeler's left hand, and hit Rutt in the chest. Rutt died later in the hospital; Wheeler survived.[51]

A block north of where Sonntag and Rutt were killed, Whitman shot and killed Harry Walchuk, a 38-year-old doctoral student and father of six. He next shot 36-year-old press reporter Robert Heard in the arm as Heard ran toward two highway patrolmen coming on the scene. Slightly north, 18-year-old freshman John Allen was wounded in the forearm as acquaintances and he looked toward the tower from the University of Texas Union.

Having seen several students shot on the South Mall, a history professor was the first to telephone the Austin Police Department at 11:52 a.m.,[87] four minutes after Whitman had first fired from the tower. Austin patrolman Billy Speed was one of the first police officers to arrive at the University; he and a colleague took refuge behind a columned stone wall. Whitman shot through the six-inch spacing between the columns of the wall and killed Speed. At a distance of approximately 1,500 feet (460 m), Whitman shot and killed 29-year-old electrical repairman Roy Schmidt as he tried to hide behind a parked car. Schmidt was the fatality who was the furthest away from the tower when hit.[88]

Students and university staff worked to assist and move the wounded to safety, risking their lives. One student later recalled: "That was the moment that separated the brave people from the scared people ... I realized I was a coward." Medical personnel used an armored car and provisioned ambulances from local funeral homes to reach the wounded.[79] On September 23, 1976, Daniel Cheney acting in his capacity as Regional Vice President of Purolator Security, donated the armored truck used that day to the Austin Police Department. Ironically, Mr. Cheney was a university student in 1966 who assisted in the evacuation of students into the same armored truck. A 30-year-old ambulance technician named Morris Hohmann was shot in the leg on West 23rd Street as he tried to evacuate the numerous wounded. The wound severed a major artery. A fellow ambulance technician gave him first aid before he was taken to Brackenridge Hospital, the only one with a local emergency room. The Brackenridge Hospital administrator declared a state of emergency. Medical staff raced there to reinforce the on-duty shifts. Numerous volunteers donated blood at both Brackenridge Hospital and the Travis County Blood Bank.[89]

The shootings and news of the sniper caused panic in and around the university. All active police officers in Austin were ordered to the campus. Off-duty officers, Travis County Sheriff's deputies, and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers also converged on the area.[89]

Approximately 20 minutes after first shooting from the observation deck, Whitman began to encounter return fire from both the police and armed civilians. One Texas Ranger used a student as spotter to help locate the sniper. At this point, Whitman chose to fire through waterspouts located on each side of the tower walls. This action largely protected him from gunfire below, but limited his range of targets.[79] Police sharpshooter Marion Lee reported from a small airplane that he had observed a single sniper firing from the observation deck. Lee tried to shoot Whitman from the plane, but the turbulence proved too great. Whitman shot at the plane, and it moved off to circle from a greater distance. Whitman never shot any of his victims more than once after they had fallen to the ground. It is believed that Whitman kept in his mind the U.S. Marine Corps tradition of "one shot, one kill" of warfare training.[89]

Entering the tower [ edit ]

Three officers who responded to reports of the sniper were Ramiro Martinez (accompanied by civilian Allen Crum), Houston McCoy, and Jerry Day.[87] Prior to advancing upon the tower, McCoy had seen his colleague Billy Speed killed.[87] Both Martinez and Day had driven to the University of Texas after listening to radio reports.[90]

Accompanied by 40-year-old civilian Allen Crum—whom the trio encountered as they ran toward the tower—they were the first to reach the tower's observation deck. After reaching the 26th floor by elevator, they encountered M. J. Gabour. Gabour—clutching his wife's shoes[7]— screamed that his family had been shot and tried to wrestle the rifle from Day to shoot Whitman himself. Day consoled Gabour and led him to safety before joining McCoy, Crum, and Martinez as they walked up to the 27th floor.[7]

Beneath the stairwell leading to the reception area, Officer Martinez saw the body of a teenaged boy, Mark Gabour. Next to him lay a middle-aged woman, Marguerite Lamport.[47] Nearby, Mike Gabour lay slumped against the wall, with his mother lying face down in a pool of blood. The officers turned Mary Gabour onto her side to prevent her from drowning in her own blood. Mike Gabour gestured to the observation deck and said, "He's out there."[90]

End of the massacre [ edit ]

Stepping outside the south door around 1:24 pm, Martinez, closely followed by McCoy, proceeded north on the east deck, while Day, followed by Crum, proceeded west on the south deck, with the intention of encircling Whitman. Several feet before he reached the southwest corner, Crum accidentally discharged the borrowed rifle, alerting Whitman that he wasn't alone on the observation deck.[90] Whitman was apparently initially unaware of Martinez and McCoy on the observation deck. He was partially shielded by the deck tower lights and in a position to defend against assaults from either corner, but his attention was drawn to where Crum had accidentally discharged his rifle.[90]

As Whitman sat crouched with his back positioned on the north wall, and looking in the northwest corner area of the observation deck where Crum's shot was heard, Martinez jumped around the corner into the northeast area and rapidly fired all six rounds from his .38 police revolver from a distance of roughly 50 feet (15 m) at Whitman – all of which missed. As Martinez fired, McCoy jumped to the right of Martinez and fired two fatal shots of 00-buckshot with his 12-gauge shotgun, hitting Whitman in the head, neck, and left side.[90]

The body of Charles Whitman lies upon the observation deck

Martinez threw down his now-empty revolver and grabbed McCoy's shotgun, running to Whitman's supine body and firing point blank into his upper left arm. Martinez threw the shotgun onto the deck and hurriedly left the scene, repeatedly shouting the words: "I got him."[2] After tending to the wounded in the stairwell, Austin Police Department (APD) Officers Milton Shoquist, Harold Moe and George Shepard ascended the stairs to join APD Officer Phillip Conner and Texas Department of Public Safety Agent W.A. Cowan, arriving on the 28th floor. Moe heard Martinez as he ran past, shouting, "I got him," and relayed his words to the APD radio dispatcher's hand-held radio.[2]

Martinez later credited the numerous civilian shooters for saving "many lives" by forcing Whitman to take cover, limiting his range of targets.[91]

Police response [ edit ]

At the time of the shootings, the Austin Police Department had no specialized tactical unit to deploy in response to reports of a sniper. Officers were equipped with revolvers and shotguns, which were ineffective against a sniper; some went home to get their own rifles. In addition, officers had few radios, and the city's phone system was overwhelmed. It was because of this particular incident that led to the creation of S.W.A.T. teams in police forces all over the U.S. [47]

Investigations [ edit ]

Autopsy [ edit ]

Although Whitman had been prescribed drugs, and was in possession of Dexedrine at the time of his death, no toxicology test was performed at first because Whitman had been embalmed on August 1, after the body was brought to the Cook Funeral Home in Austin. However, an autopsy had been requested in the suicide notes left by Whitman, and was then approved by his father.[92]

On August 2, an autopsy was conducted upon the body of Charles Whitman by Dr. Chenar (a neuropathologist at Austin State Hospital) at the Cook Funeral Home in Austin, Texas. Urine and blood were removed to test for traces of amphetamines or other substances.[93] During the autopsy, Dr. Chenar discovered a brain tumor which he labeled an astrocytoma, and noted it was approximately the size of a pecan. He also observed a small amount of necrosis in the tumor, and concluded that the tumor had no effect on Whitman's actions the previous day. This result was later revised by the Connally Commission (see below).[94]

Connally Commission [ edit ]

In the days following the shootings, Texas Governor John Connally commissioned a task force of professionals to examine the physical autopsy findings and material related to Whitman's actions and motives. The commission was composed of neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, pathologists, psychologists, and the University of Texas Health Center Directors, Dr. John White and Dr. Maurice Heatly. The Connally Commission did toxicology tests on various organs of Whitman a few weeks after the body of Whitman was exhumed. The toxicology tests revealed nothing significant. They examined Dr. Chenar's paraffin blocks of the tumor, stained specimens of it and Whitman's other brain tissue, in addition to the remainder of the autopsy specimens available.[95]

Following a three-hour hearing on August 5,[96] the Commission said that the findings of Dr. Chenar's initial autopsy conducted on August 2 had been in error; that a tumor was found that conceivably could have had an influence on Whitman's actions. Specifically, the Commission's autopsy material, including a paraffin block containing two pieces of brain tumor, were reviewed by Drs. William O. Russell (Head Pathology at MD Anderson Hospital, and Head of the Pathology Work Group of a government study panel), Kenneth M. Earle (Chief Neuropathology Branch, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology), Joseph A. Jachimczyk (Clinical Professor of Forensic Pathology at Univ Texas), and Paul I. Yakovlev (Clinical Professor of Neuropathology and Curator, Warren Museum, Emeritus, Harvard Medical School and Consultant in Neuropathology at Mass General Hospital).[97] The report, dated September 8, 1966, found that a tumor reportedly removed from the right temporal-occipital white matter by Dr. Chenar had features of a glioblastoma multiforme, with widespread areas of necrosis and palisading of cells.[94] The report also indicated a "remarkable vascular component", which was described as having "the nature of a small congenital vascular malformation." The psychiatric reviewers contributing to the Connally report concluded that "the relationship between the brain tumor and ... Whitman's actions ... cannot be established with clarity. However, the ... tumor conceivably could have contributed to his inability to control his emotions and actions",[98] while the neurologists and neuropathologists concluded: "The application of existing knowledge of organic brain function does not enable us to explain the actions of Whitman on August first."[99]

Forensic investigators have theorized that the tumor may have been pressed against the nearby amygdala region of his brain. The brain contains two amygdalae, one on each side, and the amygdalae are known to affect fight-or-flight responses. Some neurologists have since speculated that Whitman's medical condition was in some way responsible for the attacks, in addition to his personal and social frames of reference.[100]

Victim aid [ edit ]

The Connally Commission recommended that the university and state aid the wounded and those affected by the events. Aid to survivors and the wounded was to include loans, with University of Texas and State of Texas agencies to temporarily assist those with medical and mental issues, and support rehabilitation. The recommendations were not put into effect by either.[101]

Investigation of medical history [ edit ]

Prescription vials at Whitman's home.

Investigating officers found that Whitman had visited several University doctors in the year prior to the shootings, who had prescribed him various medications. Whitman had seen a minimum of five doctors between the fall and winter of 1965, before he had visited a psychiatrist (he received no prescription from the latter). He was prescribed Valium by Dr. Jan Cochrum, who recommended he visit the campus psychiatrist.[102]

Whitman met with Maurice Dean Heatly, the staff psychiatrist at the University of Texas Health Center, on March 29, 1966.[103] Whitman referred to his visit with Heatly in his final suicide note. He said, "I talked with a Doctor once for about two hours and tried to convey to him my fears that I felt come [sic] overwhelming violent impulses. After one visit, I never saw the Doctor again, and since then have been fighting my mental turmoil alone, and seemingly to no avail."[46]

During Whitman's command of the tower, the university learned that the shooter might have been a student. Once his identity was released, officials conducted a search of Whitman's records and found that Whitman had visited the University Health Center on several occasions. The University did not release the medical records and academic history of Whitman at the University of Texas, citing legal and ethical issues.[104]

Dr. Heatly's notes on the visit reflected Whitman's own comments about feeling hostility:

This massive, muscular youth seemed to be oozing with hostility [...] that something seemed to be happening to him and that he didn't seem to be himself.[105]

Dr. Heatly also referred to a statement by Whitman:

He readily admits having overwhelming periods of hostility with a very minimum of provocation. Repeated inquiries attempting to analyze his exact experiences were not too successful with the exception of his vivid reference to 'thinking about going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people'.[106]

Funeral [ edit ]

A joint funeral service for Charles Whitman and his mother, Margaret, was held at their family's home parish of Sacred Heart in Lake Worth on August 5, 1966. The Catholic service was officiated by Fr. Tom Anglin. As a veteran, Whitman was entitled to burial with full military honors; his casket was draped with the American flag. He was buried in Florida's Hillcrest Memorial Park next to his mother.[107][108] His brother John M., who was murdered outside a Lake Worth nightclub in 1973, was later buried next to his mother and brother.[109][110][111]

Memorials [ edit ]

Observation deck [ edit ]

Following the shootings, the tower observation deck was closed to visitors. In 1967, the University of Texas spent $5,000 to repair the bullet holes left from the shooting. The tower reopened in 1968. Following the suicides of four people from the tower's reopening until 1974, it was closed to the public for a second time in 1975.[112] It reopened September 15, 1999, but only by controlled access. Visitors are allowed only with guided tours scheduled by prior appointment, and after being screened by metal detectors. Other security measures, including stainless steel lattice, were installed.[113][114]

University of Texas Memorial Garden [ edit ]

In January 2003, the University of Texas at Austin committed $200,000 and sought another $800,000 to redesign the "Memorial Garden" dedicated to recognize the deaths of August 1, 1966. The Memorial Garden was dedicated in 2006, 40 years after the event.[115] A bronze plaque, dedicated to all who were affected, was placed near the pond.[116]

"Tower Heroes" plaque [ edit ]

In 2008, on the 42nd anniversary of the attacks, the following names were added to a plaque on an Austin police precinct building, dedicated to officers and civilians who helped stop Whitman on August 1, 1966.[117] With the exception of Billy Speed, the only officer killed by the sniper, and Marion Lee, a sharpshooter trying to operate from a plane, the names on the plaque are of those who acted within the tower; the list is recognized to be incomplete.[2]

Officer Billy Paul Speed. The only Austin police officer killed August 1, 1966.

Officer Phillip Conner of Austin. An ex-Army medic who administered first aid and who covered the west window of the tower while officers went onto the observation deck.

Officer Jerry Day of Universal City. Moved a wounded victim out of the line of fire before ascending alone to the top of the tower.

Lt. Marion Lee. The police sharpshooter in the airplane piloted by Jim Boutwell.

Officer Ramiro Martinez of New Braunfels. Made his way onto the tower deck and was the first to shoot at Whitman.

Officer Houston McCoy of Menard. The officer who killed Whitman and ended the siege. McCoy died on December 27, 2012. [118]

Officer Harold Moe of Marble Falls. Instrumental in saving the lives of two gunshot victims. Moe used the only portable two-way radio to notify police that the siege was over. Officer George Shepard (posthumously). Instrumental in saving the lives of two gunshot victims.

Officer Milton Shoquist of Fair Oaks Ranch. Instrumental in saving the lives of two gunshot victims.

Department of Public Safety Agent W.A. Cowan. Instrumental in setting up communications in the tower and removing people to safety on the 27th floor.

Jim Boutwell. Volunteered use of his airplane and flew it around the tower to gather information and help subdue the sniper. [119]

Allen Crum (civilian and posthumously). Made his way atop the UT Tower with a weapon provided by Agent Cowan, assisted Officer Martinez, and backed up Officer Day on the south side of the observation deck.

Frank Holder (posthumously). Elevator mechanic for Otis Elevator Co. led officers up the tower and helped them negotiate the stairs leading to the observation deck.

William Wilcox (civilian and posthumously). Engineer for UT Physical Plant, led officers through the underground tunnels to safely enter the tower building.[2]

Popular culture [ edit ]

Whitman is portrayed by Kurt Russell in the 1975 made-for-TV movie The Deadly Tower.[120]

The Peter Bogdanovich film Targets (1968) was loosely based on the massacre.

Whitman is discussed at length in the Stanley Kubrick film Full Metal Jacket (1987).[121]

The character Det. Jack Scagnetti in Natural Born Killers is the son of someone murdered by Whitman.

The Whitman murders are referenced in the Season 5 Mad Men episode, "Signal 30", that originally aired in 2012.

Kinky Friedman's song, "The Ballad of Charles Whitman", from the 1973 album SOLD AMERICAN, offers a satirical look at the man and the incident.[122]

The song "Sniper" by Harry Chapin references the shootings.

Insane Clown Posse's song "The Tower" is based off of this rampage.

The sniper scene of John Singleton's Higher Learning is based off Whitman's 1966 shooting.

The old anarchist in Richard Linklater's film Slacker (1990) talks about Whitman's shooting, saying how he was almost there that day.

For other uses, see Hermaphrodite (disambiguation)

In biology, a hermaphrodite is an organism that has reproductive organs normally associated with both male and female sexes.[1] Many taxonomic groups of animals (mostly invertebrates) do not have separate sexes.[2] In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which both partners can act as the "female" or "male". For example, the great majority of tunicates, pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.

Historically, the term hermaphrodite has also been used to describe ambiguous genitalia and gonadal mosaicism in individuals of gonochoristic species, especially human beings. The word intersex has come into preferred usage for humans, since the word hermaphrodite is considered to be misleading and stigmatizing,[3][4] as well as "scientifically specious and clinically problematic".[5]

A rough estimate of the number of hermaphroditic animal species is 65,000.[6] Since the estimated total number of animal species is 8.6 million, the percentage of animal species that are hermaphroditic is about .7%. Arthropods are the phylum with the largest number of species. Most hermaphroditic species exhibit some degree of self-fertilization. The distribution of self-fertilization rates among animals is similar to that of plants, suggesting that similar processes are operating to direct the evolution of selfing in animals and plants.[6]

Etymology [ edit ]

The term derives from the Latin: hermaphroditus, from Ancient Greek: ἑρμαφρόδιτος hermaphroditos,[7] which derives from Hermaphroditos ( Ἑρμαϕρόδιτος), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology. According to Ovid, he fused with the nymph Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of male and female sexes;[8] according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus, he was born with a physical body combining male and female sexes.[9] The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon as early as the late fourteenth century.[10] Alexander ab Alexandro stated, using the term hermaphrodite, that the people who bore the sexes of both man and woman were regarded by the Athenians and the Romans as monsters, and thrown into the sea at Athens and into the Tiber at Rome.[11]

Zoology [ edit ]

Sequential hermaphrodites [ edit ]

Crepidula fornicata (common slipper shell). Shells of(common slipper shell).

Clownfish are initially male; the largest fish in a group becomes a female.

Most species of parrotfish start life as females and later change into males.

Sequential hermaphrodites (dichogamy) occur in species in which the individual is born as one sex, but can later change into the opposite sex.[12] This contrasts simultaneous hermaphrodites, in which an individual may possess fully functional male and female gonads. Sequential hermaphroditism is common in fish (particularly teleost fish) and some jellyfish, many gastropods (such as the common slipper shell), and some flowering plants. While some sequential hermaphrodites can change sex multiple times, most can only change sex once.[citation needed] Sequential hermaphroditism can best be understood in terms of behavioral ecology and evolutionary life history theory, as described in the size-advantage mode[13] first proposed by Michael T. Ghiselin[14] which states that if an individual of a certain sex could significantly increase its reproductive success after reaching a certain size, it would be to their advantage to switch to that sex.

Sequential hermaphrodites can be divided into three broad categories:

Protandry : Where an organism is born as a male, and then changes sex to a female. [12] Example: The clownfish (genus Amphiprion ) are colorful reef fish found living in symbiosis with sea anemones. Generally one anemone contains a 'harem ', consisting of a large female, a smaller reproductive male, and even smaller non-reproductive males. If the female is removed, the reproductive male will change sex and the largest of the non-reproductive males will mature and become reproductive. It has been shown that fishing pressure can change when the switch from male to female occurs, since fishermen usually prefer to catch the larger fish. The populations are generally changing sex at a smaller size, due to natural selection.

: Where an organism is born as a male, and then changes sex to a female. Protogyny : Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male. [12] Example: wrasses (Family Labridae) are a group of reef fish in which protogyny is common. Wrasses also have an uncommon life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group.

: Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male. Bidirectional Sex Changers : where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life. [12] Example: Lythrypnus dalli (Family Lythrypnus) are a group of coral reef fish in which bidirectional sex change occurs. Once a social hierarchy is established a fish changes sex according to its social status, regardless of the initial sex, based on a simple principle: if the fish expresses subordinate behavior then it changes its sex to female, and if the fish expresses dominant or not subordinate behavior then the fish changes its sex to male. [15]

: where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life.

Dichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, groupers are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often aquacultured. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the broodstock are extremely valuable individuals.

Simultaneous hermaphrodites [ edit ]

Turbellarians mating by penis fencing . Each has two penises on the undersides of their heads which they use to inject sperm.

Earthworms are simultaneous hermaphrodites, having both male and female reproductive organs.

A simultaneous (or synchronous) hermaphrodite (or homogamous) is an adult organism that has both male and female sexual organs at the same time.[12] Self-fertilization often occurs.

Reproductive system of gastropods: Pulmonate land snails and land slugs are perhaps the best-known kind of simultaneous hermaphrodite, and are the most widespread of terrestrial animals possessing this sexual polymorphism. Sexual material is exchanged between both animals via spermatophore, which can then be stored in the spermatheca. After exchange of spermatozoa, both animals will lay fertilized eggs after a period of gestation; then the eggs will proceed to hatch after a development period. Snails typically reproduce in early spring and late autumn.

Banana slugs are one example of a hermaphroditic gastropod. Mating with a partner is more desirable biologically, as the genetic material of the resultant offspring is varied, but if mating with a partner is not possible, self-fertilization is practiced. The male sexual organ of an adult banana slug is quite large in proportion to its size, as well as compared to the female organ. It is possible for banana slugs, while mating, to become stuck together. If a substantial amount of wiggling fails to separate them, the male organ will be bitten off (using the slug's radula), see apophallation. If a banana slug has lost its male sexual organ, it can still mate as a female, making its hermaphroditic quality a valuable adaptation.

Hamlets, unlike other fish, seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights.

Earthworms are another example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Although they possess ovaries and testes, they have a protective mechanism against self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction occurs when two worms meet and exchange gametes, copulating on damp nights during warm seasons. Fertilized eggs are protected by a cocoon, which is buried on or near the surface of the ground.

The free-living hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%. [16]

reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%. The mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias marmaratus) is a species of fish that lives along the east coast of North, Central and South America. These fish are simultaneous hermaphrodites. K. marmoratus produces eggs and sperm by meiosis and routinely reproduces by self-fertilization. Each individual hermaphrodite normally fertilizes itself when an egg and sperm produced by an internal organ unite inside the fish’s body.[17]

Pseudohermaphroditism [ edit ]

Main article: Pseudohermaphroditism

A photograph by Nadar of an intersex person displaying genitalia, one of a nine-part series . The series may be the earliest medical photographic documentation of intersex

When spotted hyenas were first discovered by explorers, they were thought to be hermaphrodites. Early observations of spotted hyenas in the wild led researchers to believe that all spotted hyenas, male and female, were born with what appeared to be a penis. The apparent penis in female spotted hyenas is in fact an enlarged clitoris, which contains an external birth canal.[19][20] It can be difficult to determine the sex of wild spotted hyenas until sexual maturity, when they may become pregnant. When a female spotted hyena gives birth, they pass the cub through the cervix internally, but then pass it out through the elongated clitoris.[21]

Humans [ edit ]

Main article: Intersex

Intersex describes a wide variety of combinations of what are considered male and female biology. Aside from having an ambiguous-looking external genitalia, true intersex in humans differs from pseudohermaphroditism in that the person's karyotype has both XX and XY chromosome pairs (46XX/46XY, 46XX/47XXY or 45X/XY mosaic). Some people who are intersex have both testicular and ovarian tissue. One possible pathophysiologic explanation of this rare phenomenon is a parthenogenetic division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an X and the other carrying a Y chromosome), the two fertilized ova are then fused together resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal (ovotestes) and genetic sex.

Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the SRY from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during meiosis. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of testes in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of SOX9, and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of ovarian tissues). Thus, testicular and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual.[22]

Botany [ edit ]

Hylocereus undatus, a hermaphrodite plant with both , a hermaphrodite plant with both carpels and stamens

Hermaphrodite is used in botany to describe a flower that has both staminate (male, pollen-producing) and carpellate (female, ovule-producing) parts. This condition is seen in many common garden plants. A closer analogy to hermaphroditism in botany is the presence of separate male and female flowers on the same individual—such plants are called monoecious. Monoecy is especially common in conifers, but occurs in only about 7% of angiosperm species.[23]

Other uses of the term [ edit ]

Main article: Intersex

Hermaphroditus , the "son" of the Greek god Hermes and the goddess Aphrodite , origin of the word "hermaphrodite".

Hermaphrodite is also used to describe any person incompatible with the biological gender binary, but in medicine, it has recently been replaced by intersex. Humans with typical reproductive organs but atypical clitoris/penis are called pseudohermaphrodites in medical literature. Pseudohermaphroditism also refers to a human possessing both the clitoris and testicles.[24]

Some people who are intersex, such as some of those with androgen insensitivity syndrome, outwardly appear completely female or male, frequently without realizing they are intersex. Other kinds of intersex conditions are identified immediately at birth because those with the condition have a sexual organ larger than a clitoris and smaller than a penis. Intersex is thought by some to be caused by unusual sex hormones; the unusual hormones may be caused by an atypical set of sex chromosomes.

Sigmund Freud (based on work by his associate Wilhelm Fliess) held fetal hermaphroditism to be a fact of the physiological development of humans.[citation needed] He based much of his theory of innate sexuality on that assumption.[citation needed] Similarly, in contemporary times, fetuses before sexual differentiation are sometimes described as female by doctors explaining the process.[25] Neither concept is technically true. Before this stage, humans are simply undifferentiated and possess a Müllerian duct, a Wolffian duct, and a genital tubercle.

Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing service in China, said it will acquire Uber Technologies Inc.’s operations in the country, ending a battle that cost the two companies billions as they competed for customers and drivers.

QuickTake The Sharing Economy

Didi will buy Uber’s brand, business and data in the country, the Chinese company said in a statement. Uber Technologies and Uber China’s other shareholders, including search giant Baidu Inc., will receive a 20 percent economic stake in the combined company. Didi founder Cheng Wei and Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick will join each other’s boards.

The truce brings to an end a bruising battle between the two companies for leadership in China’s fast-growing ride-hailing market. Uber has been spending at least $1 billion a year to gain ground in China, while Didi offered its own subsidies to drivers and riders to build its business.

“Didi Chuxing and Uber have learned a great deal from each other over the past two years,” said Cheng, who is also CEO, in the statement. “This agreement with Uber will set the mobile transportation industry on a healthier, more sustainable path of growth at a higher level.”

Didi’s valuation after the deal will be $35 billion, said people familiar with the matter, asking not to be named because the details aren’t public.

Last year, China’s ride-hailing leaders Didi and Kuaidi joined forces, creating a homegrown juggernaut to fight off Uber. The merged company Didi Chuxing brought together backers Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the country’s most valuable internet businesses. Apple Inc. joined in this year with a $1 billion investment in Didi, in a round that valued the company at about $28 billion. The Chinese government passed a new rule last week that legalized ride-hailing services, paving the way for further expansion of these businesses.

Uber’s investors had been clamoring for the company to sell off its China assets and focus on more promising opportunities. Uber has lost more than $2 billion in the country, people familiar with the matter said. Meanwhile, Uber was profitable in developed markets in the first half of 2015, the people said.

“As an entrepreneur, I’ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,” Kalanick wrote in a blog post obtained by Bloomberg before publication. “I have no doubt that Uber China and Didi Chuxing will be stronger together.”

The deal is subject to government approval. While the combination of the top two players in a market would often raise regulatory scrutiny, officials will have to determine the range of competition. "The ministry of commerce has to define the size of the market and see if the car-hailing business Didi and Uber are offering can be replaced by similar services,” said Deng Zhisong, senior partner at Beijing-based law firm Dentons. “If you count taxi services and public transportation, the car-hailing sector will not have a market share that significant.”

The purchase of Uber’s China business may complicate Didi’s alliance with other ride-hailing startups around the world. Didi had agreed to work with the U.S.’s Lyft Inc., India’s Ola and Southeast Asia’s Grab to create a global force to take on Uber. Grab CEO Anthony Tan said in a statement on Monday that the impending deal is a victory for Didi and underscores how the ride-hailing business favors domestic players.

In China, Uber ventured where few U.S. technology companies have succeeded. In 2005, Yahoo! Inc. made a similar deal, selling its businesses in China to Alibaba, along with a $1 billion investment -- one of the Silicon Valley company’s best bets.

"China is such a tough market, in terms of regulation, competition and culture; they faced challenges on so many fronts," said Li Yujie, an analyst at RHB Research Institute Sdn in Hong Kong. "Cooperating with rather than fighting Didi might not be such a bad idea."

While Uber will walk away from operations in China, it is taking a significant stake in the largest player there. By shedding its massive losses in China, the move could help Uber clear the path for an eventual initial public offering.

“Uber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China, and both companies have yet to turn a profit there,” Kalanick wrote in the blog post. “Getting to profitability is the only way to build a sustainable business that can best serve Chinese riders, drivers and cities over the long term.”

The San Francisco-based company is ramping up spending in new technologies such as mapping and driverless cars following new investments into the company earlier this year.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A blow-up of a small section of a 1024x768 (VESA XGA) resolution image; the individual pixels are more visible in its scaled form than its normal resolution.

A video scaler is a system which converts video signals from one display resolution to another; typically, scalers are used to convert a signal from a lower resolution (such as 480p standard definition) to a higher resolution (such as 1080i high definition), a process known as "upconversion" or "upscaling" (by contrast, converting from high to low resolution is known as "downconversion" or "downscaling").

Video scalers are typically found inside consumer electronics devices such as televisions, video game consoles, and DVD or Blu-ray disc players, but can also be found in other AV equipment (such as video editing and television broadcasting equipment). Video scalers can also be a completely separate devices, often providing simple video switching capabilities. These units are commonly found as part of home theatre or projected presentation systems. They are often combined with other video processing devices or algorithms to create a video processor that improves the apparent definition of video signals.

Video scalers are primarily a digital device; however, they can be combined with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, or digitizer) and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to support analog inputs and outputs.

Process [ edit ]

This is a comparison of several common video resolutions. The more pixels in an image the greater the possibility for finer detail and fidelity

The "native resolution" of a display is how many physical pixels make up each row and column of the visible area on the display's output surface.[1] There are many different video signals in use which are not the same resolution (neither are all of the displays), thus some form of resolution adaptation is required to properly frame a video signal to a display device. For example, within the United States, there are NTSC, ATSC, and VESA video standards each with several different resolution video formats. Multiple common resolutions are also used for high-definition television; 720p, 1080i, and 1080p.

While scaling a video signal does allow it to match the size of a particular display, the process can result in an increased number of visual artifacts in the signal, such as ringing and posterization.

Scaling by television channels [ edit ]

Television channels which air a mixture of 16:9 (or high definition) programming and 4:3 (or standard definition) programming may employ scaling and/or cropping in order to make the programming fill the entire screen, as opposed to pillarboxing the feed instead, in order to maintain consistency in format.[2][3] Likewise, as opposed to "center-cropping", channels may downscale programming produced in 16:9 for broadcast on their 4:3 feeds through letterboxing—either as a full 16:9 letterbox, or a partial 14:9 letterbox—a technique used primarily by European broadcasters during the transition to digital terrestrial television.[4] The Active Format Description standard is a system of variables defining various scaling, letterboxing, and pillarboxing states; broadcasting equipment and televisions can be configured to automatically switch to the appropriate state based on the AFD flag encoded in the content and the aspect ratio of the display.[5]

When the U.S. cable network TNT introduced an HD feed in 2004, it controversially employed a stretching system known as FlexView (which was also offered to other broadcasters). FlexView used a nonlinear method to stretch more near the edges of the screen than in the center of it. The practice was imposed by the senior vice president of broadcast engineering at TNT, Clyde D. Smith, who argued that pillarboxing could cause burn-in on plasma televisions, some older HDTVs could not stretch 4:3 content automatically, the quality of stretching on some displays was poor, and also desired a more consistent viewing experience with no "jarring" transitions to 4:3 programming.[2] Despite TNT's intentions, the system was frequently criticized by viewers of high definition channels, with some nicknaming the effect "Stretch-O-Vision".[2][6]

In 2014, FXX faced similar criticism for its use of cropping and scaling on reruns of The Simpsons (which only started producing episodes in HD beginning in its 20th season), as its cropping method caused various visual gags to be lost. In February 2015, FXX announced that in response to these complaints, it would present these episodes in their original 4:3 aspect ratio on its video-on-demand service.[3][7]

It’s using a suite of new “cognitive” services recently added to Microsoft’s cloud computing service, called Azure.

“Customers are going to mature from classic cloud services to services that use elements of machine learning and AI,” says Herain Oberoi, director of product management at Microsoft, who oversees the company’s cloud machine-learning services. “Every company I talk with has someone extremely senior tasked with thinking about how to make this technology work for them.”

Microsoft’s competitors Google, IBM, and Amazon are making the same bet. Google announced in June that it had invented a new kind of chip to accelerate machine-learning software and make its cloud services more competitive. The company lags Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud market, and CEO Sundar Pichai has said machine-learning services provide a way for Google to differentiate itself. Amazon’s cloud division, Amazon Web Services, launched its first machine-learning cloud services last year, and in June the group’s head, Andy Jassy, pledged to expand them significantly in the coming months.

Amazon and its largest competitors stepped up their investments in machine-learning technology in recent years after breakthroughs in software that can be trained to do tasks such as interpret photos or speech (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”).

Some of the first consumer products to take advantage of those breakthroughs were Amazon’s Alexa voice-operated home assistant and Google’s new Photos service, which understands the content of images and has more than 200 million users. Adding machine learning to the cloud services that corporations already use to outsource tasks such as data storage and analysis is seen as another way to extract money from the technology and enhance the very lucrative market. IDC estimates that corporations spent almost $70 billion with cloud providers last year, and predicts that will double before the end of the decade.

Rob Craft, who leads product management for Google's cloud machine-learning offerings, says that most companies are in a position to benefit from machine learning right away because they have a lot of data on hand about their operations, business, and customers. “Our goal is to help them have more direct value from that data,” he says.

The most straightforward of the new services offered by Google and others do things like describe the content of images, transcribe audio files such as phone calls, extract key terms from text, or translate text between languages. Although seen as lagging behind Google in machine-learning technology, Microsoft and IBM have so far rolled out the broadest range of such services, known as APIs.

Microsoft has an API that tries to decipher facial expressions, for example. IBM has one that assesses the personality of the author of text such as social media posts. Marketing company Influential uses it to help brands such as Corona and Red Bull identify the most useful social media users for promotional efforts. Different APIs can be combined. For example, a company could set up a system that spots its logo in social media images, notes the facial expression of any people in the photo, and extracts key terms from any accompanying text.

Many key software components needed to build the kind of machine-learning systems that Google and others hope will be so valuable are free (see “Facebook Joins Stampede of Tech Giants Giving Away AI Technology”). But Jimoh Ovbiagele, cofounder and chief technology officer at startup ROSS Intelligence, which provides software that speeds up legal research to major law firms, says that the time and expense of building and operating a top-notch machine-learning system means many companies are better off renting the technology.

“It makes sense to stand on the shoulders of giants,” says Ovbiagele. ROSS’s ability to understand legal questions is built on IBM’s suite of language processing technology, some of which originated with the Watson computer that beat two Jeopardy! champions in 2011.

Chris Curran, chief technologist with PwC, says most large corporations are still far from ready to spend significantly on machine-learning services, though. He estimates about three quarters are in “watch and learn” mode, waiting to see what these new capabilities offer.

And while the new services from Microsoft and others make it easy for non-technology companies like Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center to use preprogrammed machine-learning systems, the technology is most valuable when customized for an organization’s specific needs, says Curran. Google and Microsoft’s image APIs are good at general assessments, such as whether a photo contains a cat or a skyscraper, for example. But a food manufacturer would get more value from a vision system able to spot specific defects in items on its production line.

All the cloud providers either already offer or have promised ways for customers to train algorithms on their own data, for their own problems. But creating customized artificial intelligence software can only be made so easy, says Curran. “You need to have the right people and expertise, and those are in short supply,” he says.
The Security of Our Election Systems

Russia was behind the hacks into the Democratic National Committee's computer network that led to the release of thousands of internal emails just before the party's convention began, U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly concluded.

The FBI is investigating. WikiLeaks promises there is more data to come. The political nature of this cyberattack means that Democrats and Republicans are trying to spin this as much as possible. Even so, we have to accept that someone is attacking our nation's computer systems in an apparent attempt to influence a presidential election. This kind of cyberattack targets the very core of our democratic process. And it points to the possibility of an even worse problem in November ­ that our election systems and our voting machines could be vulnerable to a similar attack.

If the intelligence community has indeed ascertained that Russia is to blame, our government needs to decide what to do in response. This is difficult because the attacks are politically partisan, but it is essential. If foreign governments learn that they can influence our elections with impunity, this opens the door for future manipulations, both document thefts and dumps like this one that we see and more subtle manipulations that we don't see.

Retaliation is politically fraught and could have serious consequences, but this is an attack against our democracy. We need to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin in some way ­ politically, economically or in cyberspace ­ and make it clear that we will not tolerate this kind of interference by any government. Regardless of your political leanings this time, there's no guarantee the next country that tries to manipulate our elections will share your preferred candidates.

Even more important, we need to secure our election systems before autumn. If Putin's government has already used a cyberattack to attempt to help Trump win, there's no reason to believe he won't do it again ­ especially now that Trump is inviting the "help."

Over the years, more and more states have moved to electronic voting machines and have flirted with Internet voting. These systems are insecure and vulnerable to attack.

But while computer security experts like me have sounded the alarm for many years, states have largely ignored the threat, and the machine manufacturers have thrown up enough obfuscating babble that election officials are largely mollified.

We no longer have time for that. We must ignore the machine manufacturers' spurious claims of security, create tiger teams to test the machines' and systems' resistance to attack, drastically increase their cyber-defenses and take them offline if we can't guarantee their security online.

Longer term, we need to return to election systems that are secure from manipulation. This means voting machines with voter-verified paper audit trails, and no Internet voting. I know it's slower and less convenient to stick to the old-fashioned way, but the security risks are simply too great.

There are other ways to attack our election system on the Internet besides hacking voting machines or changing vote tallies: deleting voter records, hijacking candidate or party websites, targeting and intimidating campaign workers or donors. There have already been multiple instances of political doxing ­ publishing personal information and documents about a person or organization ­ and we could easily see more of it in this election cycle. We need to take these risks much more seriously than before.

Government interference with foreign elections isn't new, and in fact, that's something the United States itself has repeatedly done in recent history. Using cyberattacks to influence elections is newer but has been done before, too ­ most notably in Latin America. Hacking of voting machines isn't new, either. But what is new is a foreign government interfering with a U.S. national election on a large scale. Our democracy cannot tolerate it, and we as citizens cannot accept it.

Last April, the Obama administration issued an executive order outlining how we as a nation respond to cyberattacks against our critical infrastructure. While our election technology was not explicitly mentioned, our political process is certainly critical. And while they're a hodgepodge of separate state-run systems, together their security affects every one of us. After everyone has voted, it is essential that both sides believe the election was fair and the results accurate. Otherwise, the election has no legitimacy.

Election security is now a national security issue; federal officials need to take the lead, and they need to do it quickly.

Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing service in China, said it will acquire Uber Technologies Inc.’s operations in the country, ending a battle that cost the two companies billions as they competed for customers and drivers.

QuickTake The Sharing Economy

Didi will buy Uber’s brand, business and data in the country, the Chinese company said in a statement. Uber Technologies and Uber China’s other shareholders, including search giant Baidu Inc., will receive a 20 percent economic stake in the combined company. Didi founder Cheng Wei and Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick will join each other’s boards.

The truce brings to an end a bruising battle between the two companies for leadership in China’s fast-growing ride-hailing market. Uber has been spending at least $1 billion a year to gain ground in China, while Didi offered its own subsidies to drivers and riders to build its business.

“Didi Chuxing and Uber have learned a great deal from each other over the past two years,” said Cheng, who is also CEO, in the statement. “This agreement with Uber will set the mobile transportation industry on a healthier, more sustainable path of growth at a higher level.”

Didi’s valuation after the deal will be $35 billion, said people familiar with the matter, asking not to be named because the details aren’t public.

Last year, China’s ride-hailing leaders Didi and Kuaidi joined forces, creating a homegrown juggernaut to fight off Uber. The merged company Didi Chuxing brought together backers Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the country’s most valuable internet businesses. Apple Inc. joined in this year with a $1 billion investment in Didi, in a round that valued the company at about $28 billion. The Chinese government passed a new rule last week that legalized ride-hailing services, paving the way for further expansion of these businesses.

Uber’s investors had been clamoring for the company to sell off its China assets and focus on more promising opportunities. Uber has lost more than $2 billion in the country, people familiar with the matter said. Meanwhile, Uber was profitable in developed markets in the first half of 2015, the people said.

“As an entrepreneur, I’ve learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,” Kalanick wrote in a blog post obtained by Bloomberg before publication. “I have no doubt that Uber China and Didi Chuxing will be stronger together.”

The deal is subject to government approval. While the combination of the top two players in a market would often raise regulatory scrutiny, officials will have to determine the range of competition. "The ministry of commerce has to define the size of the market and see if the car-hailing business Didi and Uber are offering can be replaced by similar services,” said Deng Zhisong, senior partner at Beijing-based law firm Dentons. “If you count taxi services and public transportation, the car-hailing sector will not have a market share that significant.”

The purchase of Uber’s China business may complicate Didi’s alliance with other ride-hailing startups around the world. Didi had agreed to work with the U.S.’s Lyft Inc., India’s Ola and Southeast Asia’s Grab to create a global force to take on Uber. Grab CEO Anthony Tan said in a statement on Monday that the impending deal is a victory for Didi and underscores how the ride-hailing business favors domestic players.

In China, Uber ventured where few U.S. technology companies have succeeded. In 2005, Yahoo! Inc. made a similar deal, selling its businesses in China to Alibaba, along with a $1 billion investment -- one of the Silicon Valley company’s best bets.

"China is such a tough market, in terms of regulation, competition and culture; they faced challenges on so many fronts," said Li Yujie, an analyst at RHB Research Institute Sdn in Hong Kong. "Cooperating with rather than fighting Didi might not be such a bad idea."

While Uber will walk away from operations in China, it is taking a significant stake in the largest player there. By shedding its massive losses in China, the move could help Uber clear the path for an eventual initial public offering.

“Uber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in China, and both companies have yet to turn a profit there,” Kalanick wrote in the blog post. “Getting to profitability is the only way to build a sustainable business that can best serve Chinese riders, drivers and cities over the long term.”
A new treatment for cotton seeds draws on beneficial microbes that live inside plants—much like the good bacteria in our own guts—to help the crops thrive in dry conditions.

The microbe-enhanced cotton, the first product from startup Indigo Agriculture, is already growing on 50,000 acres spread across five different states in the southern United States. Indigo CEO David Perry says the treatment increases yield as much as irrigation can. The company also today announced a new $100 million investment round that brought its venture funding total to $156 million.

Many experts argue that global agricultural productivity is not growing fast enough to keep up with the increase in global demand for food. Intense competition for land and pressures to reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide use have led technologists to search for new ways to increase yield. Adding beneficial microbes to crops could be an effective but less controversial alternative to genetic engineering.

A field of cotton from seeds treated with Indigo’s microbes.

Seed treatments containing such microbes are part of an emerging class of agricultural technologies known as “biologicals.” The microbiome—the communities of bacteria and fungi that live in the soil around the roots, on the surface of the plant, and inside the plant tissue—contributes to a plant’s health and growth. The idea is that by isolating these good bacteria and fungi and then adding them back into the plant, they could stimulate more growth and make crops healthier.

Agriculture companies including Monsanto have already released a number of microbial products. But most of what’s on the market now is focused on organisms that live in soil. Indigo’s focus is on so-called endophytes, or the bacteria and fungi that actually live in the plant tissue. Researchers have studied the interactions between these particular microbes and their plant hosts for several decades, but are just now beginning to realize how to apply what they've learned, according to Betsy Arnold, a professor of plant sciences and ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, and an academic collaborator with Indigo.

On the left are cotton plants grown with Indigo’s seed treatment. On the right are untreated crops.

Recent advances in DNA sequencing and inexpensive computing have made it more economical to perform computational analysis on huge databases of microbial genetic information in search of insights that might help improve crops. Indigo has built a database of tens of thousands of individual microbes isolated from crops that thrive under harsh conditions. The company’s scientists use machine learning and other techniques to probe that data in search of new insights.

Tyler McClendon, president of Oxbow Agriculture, which is currently growing 1,000 acres of Indigo’s cotton, says he believes Indigo’s focus on isolating specific microörganisms that seem to help plants thrive under stress makes more sense than the “broad based,” soil-focused approaches other companies are taking.

McClendon says Indigo’s business model is also unique, in that the final cost of the technology to the farmer is tied to a “measurable increase in crop yield.” Under the traditional model, farmers must pay for everything up front and then hope for the best, says Perry. Indigo doesn’t ask for much financial commitment up front, he says. Instead, he says, “we ask for a share of the value we create at harvest.” McClendon says this kind of approach makes farmers more receptive and could speed the adoption of new biotechnologies.

Adam Segal, the Ira A Lipman Chair for Emerging Technologies and National Security and director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, is the author of The Hacked World Order: How Nations Fight, Trade, Maneuver, and Manipulate in the Digital Age,

After years of public reporting on the theft of intellectual property, business strategies, and trade secrets, last month the cybersecurity firm FireEye issued a report headlining a steep decline in Chinese cyber espionage against organizations in the US and 25 other countries.

The number of network compromises by 72 suspected China-based groups dropped from 60 in February 2013 to less than 10 by May 2016. While FireEye did not rule out the possibility that improvements in tradecraft were leading to less detection (FBI Director James Comey once compared Chinese hackers to drunk burglars who kick in the door and knock over a vase on their way out with the TV), US Assistant Attorney General John Carlin confirmed the company’s findings that attacks were less voluminous but more focused and calculated.

A combination of the threat of US sanctions, a diplomatic accord signed by President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping, and internal reforms of the People’s Liberation Army may have temporarily produced a dramatic decline in cyber espionage, but is it time to shut down the firewall, send the threat intelligence analysts home, and declare victory? Very unlikely.

China hacks because it wants to move its economy from labor intensive manufacturing to high technology innovation.

For Beijing, cyberspace is essential to economic growth, sustaining and strengthening the Chinese Communist Party, and maintaining domestic stability and national security. As a result, China hacks because it wants to move its economy from labor intensive manufacturing to high technology innovation; defeat foreign ideologies and weaken opponents of the regime; and counter the technological advantages of the US military in the Pacific.

These fundamental motivations direct state-backed hackers to a set of high value targets. Because Chinese leaders do not want to be dependent on foreign technology suppliers, and are impatient with the results produced so far by massive investments in education and scientific research, Chinese hackers steal intellectual property from high technology companies as well as business secrets from the pharmaceutical, financial, energy, legal, and other sectors. “The situation that our country is under others' control in core technologies of key fields has not changed fundamentally, and the country's S&T foundation remains weak," President Xi Jinping told a gathering of the nation’s top scientists in May 2016. The companies breached are global, with victims identified in Germany, Australia, Japan, India, and the United Kingdom.

Worried about the spread of ideologies that threaten regime legitimacy, and the ability of domestic opponents to organize and foment dissent, Beijing supports cyber attacks on Tibetan and Uighur activists, NGOS and think tanks, and the diplomatic, military, and political agencies of all the major powers. When the New York Times and Bloomberg published stories about the massive wealth amassed by the families of China’s top leaders, they, along with other media outlets, were hacked.

Chinese hackers also conduct intelligence and counterintelligence operations. The theft of 22 million records from servers of the Office of Personnel Management included information perfect for blackmail, and might also allow Chinese counterintelligence agencies to identify spies working undercover at US embassies around the world.

Chinese defense planners are preparing the PLA to fight "informationized local wars": short, technologically-intense regional wars. The potential enemy in these future wars is usually referred to as a “technologically advanced” adversary but is clearly a stand-in for the United States and its allies. As a result, these planners want to both understand and disrupt US weapons platforms. Two PLA groups, Units 61938 and 61486, have reportedly stolen information from over two dozen Defense Department weapons programs, including the Patriot missile system, the US Navy’s new littoral combat ship, and the F-35 and F-22 stealth fighter jets.

Cyberspace remains central to all of Beijing’s predominant economic and political interests, and cyber attacks are, and will continue to be, a potent tool.



If a conflict breaks out over Taiwan or the South China Sea, the PLA will want to disrupt communication, transportation, intelligence, and reconnaissance systems, so hackers have mapped these networks. In addition, Chinese leaders want to signal to US policymakers that the conflict may not stay regional, and so PLA operators have penetrated into banking, energy, and other critical infrastructure networks, and may have intentionally left evidence of the intrusions as a reminder that the US homeland is not immune to attack.

Given Beijing’s long-term strategic concerns about technological innovation, domestic stability, and national security, Chinese hackers may change tactics and organization, but they will remain focused on a similar set of targets.The creation of the Strategic Support Forces, a move intended to centralize space, cyber and information warfare troops, will result in greater coordination among the many different hacking groups and better tradecraft overall.

Continued tension over China’s sovereignty claims in the South China Sea mean that the networks of the US military and its regional allies will remain prime targets. As the economy moves up the value chain, and as Chinese technology companies like Xiaomi, Huawei, and AliBaba compete in global markets, cyber economic espionage will be narrower and more tailored to specific technologies. The attacks on domestic opponents and outside ideological threats are will become more sophisticated and increase in pace as the Chinese Communist Party appears increasingly worried about domestic stability, regime legitimacy, and the spread of information within China.

Chinese leaders will also be watching closely how the Obama administration responds to the alleged Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Like Moscow, Beijing also believes that it is in an ideological contest with the West and it has tried to shape the information space, though in a more limited way, for example by trolling Tibetan independence activists on Twitter and using distributed denial of service attacks to knock GitHub offline for hosting anti-censorship technology.

However, the complex interdependence of the Chinese and US economies and a greater slate of shared interests in global affairs make a hack as brazen as an effort to influence the US election highly improbable. Still, cyberspace remains central to all of Beijing’s predominant economic and political interests, and cyber attacks are, and will continue to be, a potent tool.

Pills containing fecal bacteria looked like they could cure an infection that kills thousands of people every year in the U.S.

The human microbiome remains a mystery. That is the hard lesson to take from Seres Therapeutics’ shocking announcement today that its experiment in using gut bacteria to treat a deadly infection has failed.

Data published earlier this year by Seres suggested its pill for treating cases of Costridium difficile could radically alter treatment of the gastrointestinal illness that in 2011 claimed 29,000 lives in the U.S. That made the company one of the most promising in a field of biotech startups hoping to harness some of the trillions of bacteria living on or in the human body to treat disease.

Seres’ drug, SER-109, is designed to treat patients with recurring C. difficile infections, which can be hard to treat. Antibiotics can sometimes worsen the condition by killing good bacteria and allowing C. difficile to thrive.

An illustration of a C. difficile bacterium that the SER-109 drug aimed to treat.

Previously, researchers demonstrated that a fecal transplant—taking a healthy person’s stool and putting it in another person—results in a remarkably successful treatment of C. difficile infections. But scientists don’t really know why it works.

The ick-factor of receiving a fecal enema resulted in the creation of the nonprofit stool bank OpenBiome, which aimed to create pills that could be taken orally instead. Seres Therapeutics took the idea a step further by creating the SER-109 pill. Here, spores from good bacterial species are isolated and encapsulated in pill form, while disease-spreading microbes like Listeria and Salmonella are eliminated.

The goal is to reintroduce the diverse population of microbes that normally live in the gut, which is disrupted during a C. difficile infection. Researchers from Seres Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, and Massachusetts General Hospital published a paper in The Journal of Infectious Diseases earlier this year saying that the SER-109 treatment was effective for preventing C. difficile infections in an early stage trial.

But results from a more advanced trial released today indicate that there was no significant difference in the outcome of patients receiving the therapy compared to those who got a placebo. In a press release, Seres noted this was “inconsistent” with their expectations.

The microbiome is having a moment, as biotech firms like Vedanta Biosciences, Synlogic, Second Genome, Enterome, and others, are all working on therapies centered around human-hosted bacteria. Seres Therapeutics themselves received $120 million in funding from Nestlé and had a market capitalization of $1.4 billion before their stock fell 78 percent on the news of the failed trail. The company has two other treatments in clinical trials—one for ulcerative colitis and a second C. difficile medication.

SER-109’s surprising flop is a humbling reminder of the microbiome’s complexity. But even if the treatment had been successful, its creators would’ve been hard-pressed to present a concrete reason why. Many microbiologists have called for a healthy dose of skepticism in microbiome studies. Its potential may be great, but for now it looks like the good old-fashioned fecal transplants still have the drugs beat out.

Mornings at 5, Mr. Dong, a manager at a livestock farming company in Tianjin, logs in to his Uber account. Before he heads off for work at 7, he can make three to four trips around the city center in his Buick. After he leaves his office at 6 p.m., he continues driving until 9 p.m. On weekend mornings, he’s in such high demand that he can complete as many as 10 trips before noon.

In China, drivers for local firm Didi Kuaidi and Uber both compete with traditional taxi drivers.

“Right now a lot of people are using these services,” says Mr. Dong, 38, who gave only his last name to avoid jeopardizing his full-time job. On top of covering his monthly gas money of about 1,000 yuan ($156), he can earn between 800 yuan ($125) and 1,000 yuan every month by driving for Uber.

Uber is in a legal gray area. Speculation has increased that regulation of online taxi reservations may be coming.

In China, private Uber drivers are making almost a million trips per day, according to the CEO of Uber. Less than two years after its launch here, Uber has developed a fierce rivalry with the homegrown Didi Kuaidi, which reports that its daily private-car requests have tripled to three million since May, and engendered resentment among traditional taxi drivers.

1,000,000 Number of trips being made daily by Uber drivers in China

Still, Chinese cities in some ways seem ripe for a technology-driven transportation overhaul. The roads are jammed. According to government figures, there were almost 126 million private vehicles in China at the end of 2014, a 15.5 percent increase from the previous year. The 2014 TomTom Traffic Index shows that a third of the 50 most congested cities in the world are in China. Other commuting options are painful, too—during rush hours a rider in the Beijing subway has to wait for several loaded trains to pass before squeezing in.

The Chinese State Council has identified transportation as one of the traditional industries whose efficiency could be improved by online platforms, but Uber remains in a legal gray area. Its drivers are considered private car operators and do not pay all the registration fees, value-added tax, and income taxes traditional cabbies do. Uber drivers say they often avoid places where there are a lot of police officers, such as airports and train stations. If they are caught, the fines can be as high as 10,000 yuan ($1,564). Recently speculation has increased that online taxi reservations will become a regulated business.

Uber’s not waiting. With the newly set up UberChina, the ride-hailing service plans to expand into 100 Chinese cities, at least half with a population over five million, in the next year. (It currently operates in 11 cities, including Tianjin, with an average population of 14 million.) The company also plans to invest more than seven billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in China in 2015.

But drivers of China’s 1.37 million traditional taxis are already reacting. In May, dozens of cabbies blocked the roads around the Olympic stadium in Tianjin with their cars and lured private-car drivers to the area using ride-hailing apps. As soon as they arrived, the two parties started fighting.

“I’m a bit dispirited,” says Lu Lifang, 48, a traditional taxi driver. “If the government doesn’t regulate the private cars, my profession will disappear sooner or later.” She and her fellow cabbies also complain about dwindling income. Wang Hongyong, 47, says he earns about 150 yuan ($23) less per day now than he did in 2014. “I’m also more tired,” he says. “I don’t rest in between.”

Driving is not a livelihood for most Uber drivers. Most, like Mr. Dong, drive for extra cash. Xing Gao, who works at an insurance company in Tianjin, hasn’t picked up any calls on his Uber app since June because the company has dropped to nearly zero the subsidy it was paying him for each completed trip. In 2014, he had a guaranteed 30 yuan ($5) subsidy per trip. “They want to test the bottom line of drivers,” says Xing, 32, “just to see how much lower they can go before you quit.”
Jean Liu explains how her ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing is besting Uber in China and why data is its biggest asset.

In May, Apple announced that it was investing $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, China’s leading car-hailing service. That’s part of a reported $7 billion the Beijing-based startup has raised in recent months. Didi, which arranges 14 million rides a day in cities across mainland China, commands about 87 percent of the private car-hailing business there. It is so dominant that its main rival, San Francisco–based Uber, recently acknowledged it is losing $1 billion annually in the country. Both companies spend heavily on marketing and on subsidizing drivers to offer lower fares. Interestingly, Uber China’s director of strategy, Liu Zhen, is a cousin of Didi’s president, Jean Liu. In an interview with reporter Christina Larson, Jean Liu said she thinks data will help Didi maintain its edge. In its four years of operation, the company has gathered information like common pickup points and destinations, peak demand times, and frequent routes in 400 Chinese cities. It’s used the data for predictive analysis and to create new products such as Didi Bus, a bus-booking service that’s become a popular alternative to crowded public buses.

See the Rest of the Package 50 Smartest Companies

Why did you come to join Didi two years ago from Goldman Sachs, where you were a managing director?

I was born and raised in Beijing. I love the city, and I also get stuck [in traffic] in the city. I studied computer science for my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, [but] I went into banking after graduation. I stayed in finance for about a dozen years. My last investment opportunity was Didi.

How has the company changed in those two years?

When I joined, there was only one business line—that was the taxi [service]. But the opportunity is so much bigger than just taxi-hailing. It’s really a world-class dilemma—how to move around 800 million urban Chinese.

China has a lot of urban density, but the public transit system really lags behind. Today our product line includes hailing taxis [working with existing taxi companies to give drivers a more efficient way to find passengers]; private car services [like the Uber model] with higher-, middle-, and lower-end [vehicles and prices]; a bus service.

The bus is like an expanded carpool shuttle service: instead of taking a public bus with many stops, and maybe no seats left, and uncomfortable, we offer a shuttle-­like service with typically just one or two stops. All the seats on the bus are prebooked. We can [use our years of data] to determine popular origins and destinations, where commuters are basically making the same journey in the morning. With the scale of this network, we can pull people together.

What role has data played in developing your new services?

When passengers want to go, they want to go in five minutes. We need to be fast and efficient. Analyzing that data, we have a very good idea, in a particular city, what demand will look like in 10 minutes. Even before the 6 p.m. rush hour, we can dispatch drivers in particular directions. We can predict at 6 p.m. on a Wednesday how many people will [hail cars] from a particular workplace. The only way you can match the supply with the demand is to do intelligent dispatching and demand prediction.

What are the differences between Didi and Uber in China?

The understanding of the local market and the local users is very different. There is a product we invented last June called Hitch, a social ride-­sharing product. Now we have half a million rides completed just on that. Daily. That’s what I mean by understanding the local market.

Uber is known, in part, for friction with its drivers. Does Didi face similar challenges or ­resentments?

We provide business opportunities to 14 million registered drivers. If you count just the drivers whose majority income comes from Didi, that’s 2.5 million on a monthly basis. We actually help drivers increase their income by increasing the efficiency of their routes. In Beijing, a lot of the private car drivers [who find customers via Didi’s app] earn four times the minimum wage. That resolves the fundamental issue for the drivers.

What are your biggest challenges?

At this stage, we spend a lot of time talking about how to recruit and retain top talent.

What’s the story behind the recent Apple investment, and how will Didi use the money?

Both of us [Apple and Didi] are invested in technology; it just seemed very intuitive. Both have a big overlap in our customers in China. We have some ideas. But bear in mind, this is a speed date: we got to know them in late April. A lot of things are still in discussion. Going forward, maybe we could use voice function [technology] from Apple; a big percentage of our users are using iPhones.
Congressional candidates running for office and being supported by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON The FBI is investigating a cyber attack against another U.S. Democratic Party group, which may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The previously unreported incident at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, and its potential ties to Russian hackers are likely to heighten accusations, so far unproven, that Moscow is trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election campaign to help Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Democratic campaign group for Congress confirms computer hack

The Kremlin denied involvement in the DCCC cyber-attack. Hacking of the party's emails caused discord among Democrats at the party's convention in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.

The newly disclosed breach at the DCCC may have been intended to gather information about donors, rather than to steal money, the sources said on Thursday.

It was not clear what data was exposed, although donors typically submit a variety of personal information including names, email addresses and credit card details when making a contribution. It was also unclear if stolen information was used to hack into other systems.

The DCCC raises money for Democrats running for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The intrusion at the group could have begun as recently as June, two of the sources told Reuters.

That was when a bogus website was registered with a name closely resembling that of a main donation site connected to the DCCC. For some time, internet traffic associated with donations that was supposed to go to a company that processes campaign donations instead went to the bogus site, two sources said.

The sources said the Internet Protocol address of the spurious site resembled one used by Russian government-linked hackers suspected in the breach of the DNC, the body that sets strategy and raises money for the Democratic Party nationwide.

Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the DNC hack to release sensitive party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election.

"I have concerns that an agency of foreign intelligence is hacking and interfering with a U.S. election," said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who added he had not seen news of the DCCC attack.

Asked by Reuters to comment on whether Russia played a role in a cyber-attack on the DCCC, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “We don’t see the point any more in repeating yet again that this is silliness.”

The release of the DNC emails by activist group WikiLeaks caused uproar in the party because they appeared to show favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race for the nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The committee is supposed to be neutral.

The DNC and the DCCC share the same office space on South Capitol Street in Washington.

The DCCC and donation processing company ActBlue had no comment on Thursday. CrowdStrike, the California-based cyber security firm that investigated the DNC breach, declined to comment.

Justin Harvey, chief security officer at Fidelis Cybersecurity company, said the suspect website in the hack was affiliated with others that host sophisticated malware undetected by the vast majority of antivirus providers.

"It's really rare malware," which would be more likely to be wielded by government hackers than ordinary criminals, he said.

GREAT CONCERN

Russian officials have dismissed allegations of Moscow's involvement in hacks of U.S. political groups. "It is so absurd it borders on total stupidity," Kremlin spokesman Peskov said on Thursday.

Some Democratic officials have accused Russia of hacking the DNC emails in order to help Trump win the race for the White House.

"It's no coincidence someone is hacking into Democratic Party computers. It's almost sounding like a repeat of Watergate," Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democrats said, after Reuters reported the DCCC hacking.

"This is just the kind of dirty politics we expect from Donald Trump. I have no doubt Donald Trump is behind it," he said, citing the businessman's praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and recent remarks about Russia and Clinton's deleted emails.

Trump angered Democrats this week by inviting Russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival Clinton's tenure as U.S. secretary of state. Trump said on Thursday his comment was meant to be sarcastic.

Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who once worked for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, said the possibility of the DCCC being hacked was cause for great concern.

“Until proven otherwise, I would suggest that everyone involved with the campaign committee operate under the assumption Russians have access to everything in their computer systems,” Manley said.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation referred questions about the DCCC attack to a statement it made on Monday about the DNC hack:

"The FBI is investigating a cyber intrusion involving the DNC and are working to determine the nature and scope of the matter. A compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace."

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Thursday the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to "make the call on attribution" as to who was responsible for the DNC hack.

Clapper, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, acknowledged: "There’s just a few usual suspects out there" who might be responsible for the cyber intrusion, suggesting it was the work of a state actor rather than an independent hacking group.

Clapper said in May he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the November election neared. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obama's campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes, officials have said.

The way technology companies grow may be broken, destructive, and wasteful. At least that’s the gospel some renegade venture capitalists at Indie.vc have been spreading. If you’re working in venture capital or tech, you might not have heard of Indie.vc yet (some partners I’ve spoken to haven’t), but at Cornerstone Venture Partners, where I’m working this summer, it comes up almost every day. To understand what’s going on, you’ll need some background on fund economics. Don’t worry, I promise it’s more exciting than it sounds.

There’s a lot of talk around the idea that really, only the upper echelon of VC funds actually return anything worthwhile to their investors. The data here is iffy and private, but it seems fair to assume that 4x on a fund over the fund’s life would be considered acceptable. As Mark Suster points out and Fred Wilson alludes to, most investments in a portfolio won’t return significantly – so firms rely on a small percentage (20-30%) of their investments to return the majority of their money (80%+). Long story short, that means that on average, VC funds make their money on the really, really big exits. It’s pretty simple but profoundly impacts their investing strategy.

What this means is that if you’ve got a business you’re pitching, VC funds are often going to be thinking, “Can this company be the billion dollar exit I need to return to my LPs?” If your business model, product, or market doesn’t support that, you’re going to have trouble with traditional venture. It’s just simple fund economics. Most of the time, you can’t fight it.

But not all businesses need to achieve billion dollar exits, or even need to exit at all. There are countless companies out there that genuinely improve people’s lives, but aren’t “huge.” They’re not fit for venture, and they’ll often try to twist and turn, in destructive ways, to get VCs to invest. And even in the businesses that VCs invest in, the laser focus on scale, scale, exit can often tear apart otherwise sustainable businesses. VCs want returns and growth, which often doesn’t align with what’s best for the business. That’s where Indie.vc comes in.

It’s structured as a VC firm with its own fund, and its term sheet is pretty straightforward – instead of taking equity up front, it gets paid back once your company has some excess cash flows. These flows are called distributions and include dividends and large increases to the founders’ salaries. Once the company makes a distribution, it begins paying Indie.vc back until Indie.vc makes 5x on its investment. If the company raises another round, then Indie.vc’s investment converts to equity – but that percentage is decided by the company (!). As far as entrepreneur-friendly term sheets go, this is definitely up there.

Indie.vc is for the businesses that don’t want VC or weren’t wanted by VC. It’s for companies focused on profitability instead of pure growth that want to run their businesses without VCs interfering. It seems focused on disrupting the current VC model, and it isn’t shy about it – its website runs a video of a burning unicorn head in the background. I think we get the message – in some ways, the disruptors (or those who fund them) are being disrupted.

But this idea isn’t as revolutionary as you might think. First of all, the similarities to a high-interest loan are hard to ignore, even if the Indie.vc model doesn’t make you liable for the principal. Lighter Capital is another firm that operates along the same guidelines. Its founder argues that this format, also called revenue-based financing, has been prevalent in industries like mining and film for a while. Indie.vc is different in that its paybacks aren’t based on revenue, but the general idea is similar. Most importantly, there are many large, successful businesses that grew without VC money. Some examples of note are: every business ever before VC existed, Atlassian, Zoho, and Airpush (nod to Michael Carney). No matter the history, this is a structured, legitimate option for your business. Unsurprisingly, Indie.vc, like other venture firms, advertises its network as an aid to startups.

So who and what is right? Despite the disruptive picture I painted, Indie.vc isn’t trying to tear down traditional VC – it’s looking to give resources to businesses that need it and that could be damaged by traditional VC investments. I prefer to see this development as parallel – another exciting, valuable funding mechanism for businesses that don’t fit the current model. I’m confident that, in general, incentives for big exits by VCs align with the vision of the founders; but not always. If you’re a business looking for some new capital, you better look long and hard at this dichotomy. If your vision isn’t to be a massive company, this type of funding might be a better fit for you.

At Cornerstone we talk to founders all the time that are interesting, driven, and impressive. They have a seed-stage business that has nice traction and solves a real need – but we can’t see any possible exit in the near future (marketplaces are a good and frequent example). We’re often quite confident that they’ll be successful over the next few years, but we don’t see how we can earn a return. It stinks to turn these companies away, but that’s fund economics. Drafting a term sheet along the Indie.vc lines could address this problem.

The way technology companies grow may just be broken, destructive, and wasteful, and it may not be. But one thing is clear – there are more options for startup funding than ever, so get to work.

EV batteries have to get a lot cheaper by 2017 if the Model 3 is to live up to its billing.

Can Tesla really deliver on its promise to offer a long-range electric vehicle that is cheap enough to attract mainstream buyers by 2017? We can’t know for sure without access to the company’s proprietary information. But one thing is clear: if Tesla is successful it will be because of significant advances to the design and manufacturing of its battery pack, which many estimates suggest represents a quarter to half of the full cost of the car.

At a launch event Thursday night in Los Angeles, Elon Musk announced that the Tesla Model 3 would have a range of 215 miles. That’s not much less than the range of the cheapest version of the older Model S sedan. But the Model S starts at nearly $70,000—twice the Model 3's $35,000 price tag.

Where might the cost savings come from? Some may come as Tesla learns to improve how efficiently it builds batteries at its "gigafactory," which is now under construction in Nevada.

In addition, Quartz’s Steve LeVine points out that Tesla and partner Panasonic have quietly been developing a new technology in which silicon is combined with the graphite used in conventional lithium-ion battery anodes. Adding silicon could increase the amount of energy the battery can store, but previous efforts to commercialize the technology have failed. Levine cites a battery market investment analyst who says that the Model 3’s anodes could contain up to 10 percent silicon, which battery experts say would be a “serious breakthrough.”

Serious enough, in fact, that it might allow Tesla to bring the cost of its batteries down from an estimated $300 per kilowatt-hour in 2014 to $200 by 2017. That would get us much closer to $150, the point at which some experts have predicted there could be a “paradigm shift” away from internal combustion cars. Unfortunately we’ll have to wait until late next year, when the first Model 3's are expected to roll off the production line, to see if Tesla truly has a breakthrough on its hands.

Decayed nitrate film. EYE Film Institute Netherlands.

Film preservation, or film restoration, describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, cinematheques, and non-profit organizations to rescue decaying film stock and preserve the images which they contain. In the widest sense, preservation nowadays assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.[1]

For many years the term "preservation" was synonymous with "duplication" of film. The goal of a preservationist was to create a durable copy without any significant loss of quality. In more modern terms, film preservation now includes the concepts of handling, duplication, storage, and access. The archivist seeks to protect the film and share the content with the public.[2]

Film preservation is not to be confused with film revisionism, in which long-completed films are subjected to outtakes never previously seen being inserted, newly inserted music scores or sound effects being added, black-and-white film being colorized or converted to Dolby stereo, or minor edits and other cosmetic changes being made.

By the 1980s, it was becoming apparent that the collections of motion picture heritage were at risk of becoming lost. Not only was the preservation of nitrate film an ongoing problem, but the discovery that safety film, used as a replacement for the more volatile nitrate stock, was beginning to be affected by a unique form of decay known as "vinegar syndrome", and color film manufactured, in particular, by Eastman Kodak, was found to be at risk of fading. At that time, the best known solution was to duplicate the original film onto a more secure medium.

90 percent of all American silent films made before 1929 and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 are lost films.[3]

Although institutional practices of film preservation date back to the 1930s,[4] the field received an official status only in 1980, when UNESCO recognized "moving images" as an integral part of the world's cultural heritage.[5]

Film decay [ edit ]

An extreme example of nitrate decomposition.

The great majority of films made in the silent era are now considered lost forever. Movies of the first half of the 20th century were filmed on an unstable, highly flammable cellulose nitrate film base, which required careful storage to slow its inevitable process of decomposition over time. Most films made on nitrate stock were not preserved; over the years, their negatives and prints crumbled into powder or dust. Many of them were recycled for their silver content, or destroyed in studio or vault fires. The largest cause, however, was intentional destruction. As film preservationist Robert A. Harris explains, "Most of the early films did not survive because of wholesale junking by the studios. There was no thought of ever saving these films. They simply needed vault space and the materials were expensive to house."[6] Silent films had little or no commercial value after the advent of sound films in the 1930s, and as such, they were not kept. As a result, preserving the now rare silent films has been a high priority amongst film historians.

Because of the fragility of film stock, proper preservation of film usually involves storing the original negatives (if they have survived) and prints in climate-controlled facilities. The vast majority of films were not stored in this manner, which resulted in the widespread decay of film stocks.

The problem of film decay is not limited to films made on cellulose nitrate. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced Technicolor) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original film productions or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. Cellulose acetate film, which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from 'vinegar syndrome'. The ongoing preservation of color films is now presented with an issue, as low temperatures, which inhibit color fading, actually increase the effects of vinegar syndrome, while higher (normal room) temperatures cause color fading.

Film decay as an art form [ edit ]

In 2002, filmmaker Bill Morrison produced Decasia, a film solely based on fragments of old unrestored nitrate-based films in various states of decay and disrepair, providing a somewhat eerie aesthetic to the film. The film was paired together with a soundtrack composed by Michael Gordon, and performed by his orchestra. The footage used was from old newsreel & archive film, and was obtained by Morrison from several sources, such as the Fox Movietone Newsfilm Archives at the University of South Carolina, and the archives of the Museum of Modern Art.

Preservation through careful storage [ edit ]

The 'preservation' of film usually refers to physical storage of the film in a climate-controlled vault, and sometimes to the actual repair and copying of the film element. Preservation is different from 'restoration', as restoration is the act of returning the film to a version most faithful to its initial release to the public and often involves combining various fragments of film elements.

Film is best preserved by proper protection from external forces while in storage along with being under controlled temperatures.[1] These measures inhibit deterioration better than any other methods and is a cheaper solution than replicating deteriorating films.

Preparing a film for preservation and restoration [ edit ]

In most cases, when a film is chosen for preservation or restoration work, new prints are created from the original camera negative or the composite restoration negative which is often made from a combination of elements for general screening.

The composite restoration negative is a compilation of duplicated sections of the best remaining material, recombined to approximate the original configuration of the original camera negative at some time in the film's release cycle, while the original camera negative is the remaining, edited, film negative that passed through the camera on the set. This original camera negative may, or may not, remain in original release form, depending upon number of subsequent re-releases after the initial release for theatrical exhibition.

In traditional photochemical restorations, image polarity considerations must be observed when recombining surviving materials and the final, lowest generation restoration master may be either a duplicate negative or a fine grain master positive.

Preservation elements, such as fine-grain master positives and duplicate printing negatives, are generated from this restoration master element to make both duplication masters and access projection prints available for future generations.

Film as archival medium [ edit ]

Film preservationists would prefer that the film images, whether restored through photochemical or digital processes, be eventually transferred to other film stock, because no digital media exists that has proven truly archival because of rapidly evolving and shifting data formats, while a well-developed and stored, modern film print can last upwards of 100 years.[7]

While some in the archival community feel that conversion from film to a digital image results in a loss of quality that can make it more difficult to create a high-quality print based upon the digital image, digital imaging technology has become increasingly advanced to the point where 8K scanners can capture the full resolution of images filmed at as high as 65mm.[8] 70mm IMAX has a resolution of 18K, which is the upper necessary limit for film capture in full resolution.[9]

Of course, having an intermediate digital stage, followed by forming a new film master by lasering the digital results onto new film stock does represent an extra generation. So would an intermediate film master that was restored frame-by-frame by hand. The choice of film vs. digital restoration will be driven by the amount, if any, of restoration required, the taste and skill set of the restorer, and the economics of film restoration vs. digital restoration.

Digital as archival medium [ edit ]

Digital scanners as of 2014 can capture images as large as 65mm in full resolution.[8] That is the typical image size on a traditional (as opposed to the IMAX process) 70mm film which used a portion of the film surface for its multitrack magnetic sound stripe. A 70mm print of a two and a half hour film as of 2012 ran upwards of $170,000. A hard disk capable of storing such a movie is a few hundred dollars. An archival optical disk will be less. The problem of having to transfer the data as new generations of equipment come along will continue, however, until true archival standards are put in place.

Digital film preservation [ edit ]

In the context of film preservation the term 'digital preservation' highlights the use of digital technology for the transfer of films from 8mm to 70mm in size to digital carriers, as well as all practices for ensuring the longevity and access to digitized or digitally born film materials. On purely technical and practical terms, digital film preservation stands for a domain specific subset of digital curation practices. Extensive technical literature on the subject can be found at the online library of the Presto Centre Project.[10]

The aesthetic and ethical implications of the use of digital technology for film preservation are major subjects of debate. For instance, the senior curator of George Eastman House Paolo Cherchi Usai has decried the shift from analogue to digital preservation of film as ethically unacceptable, arguing, on philosophical terms, that the medium of film is an essential ontological precondition for the existence of cinema.[11] More recently, the senior curator of EYE Film Institute Netherlands Giovanna Fossati has discussed the use of digital technologies for the restoration and preservation of film in a more optimistic way as a form of remediation of the cinematic medium, and has positively reflected on digital technologies' ability to broaden restoration possibilities, improve quality, and reduce costs.[12] According to the cinema scholar Leo Enticknap, the views held by Usai and Fossati could be seen as representative of the two poles of the digital debate in film preservation.[13] It should be kept in mind, however, that both Usai and Fossati's arguments are highly complex and nuanced, and likewise, the debate about the utility of digital technologies in film preservation is complex and continually evolving.

Advancements [ edit ]

In 1935, New York's Museum of Modern Art began one of the earliest institutional attempts to collect and preserve motion pictures, obtaining original negatives of the Biograph and Edison companies, and the world's largest collection of D. W. Griffith films.[14] The following year, Henri Langlois founded the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, which would become the world's largest international film collection.[15]

For thousands of early silent films stored in the Library of Congress, mostly between 1894 and 1912, the only existing copies were printed on rolls of paper submitted as copyright registrations.[16] For these, an optical printer was used to copy these images onto safety film stock, a project that began in 1947 and continues today.[citation needed] The Library hosts the National Film Preservation Board, whose National Film Registry annually selects 25 U.S. films "showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage."[17] The George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film was chartered in 1947 to collect, preserve and present the history of photography and film, and in 1996 opened the Louis B. Mayer Conservation Center, one of only four film conservation centers in the United States.[18] The American Film Institute was founded in 1967 to train the next generation of filmmakers and preserve the American film heritage.[19] Its collection now includes over 27,500 titles.

In 1978, Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada, a construction excavation inadvertently found a forgotten collection of more than 500 discarded films from the early 20th century that were buried in and preserved in the permafrost.[20] This fortunate discovery was shared and moved to the United States' Library of Congress[21] and Library and Archives Canada for transfer to safety stock and archiving.[22]

Another high-profile restoration by staff at the British Film Institute's National Film and Television Archive is the Mitchell and Kenyon collection, which consists almost entirely of actuality films commissioned by traveling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century. The collection was stored for many decades in two large barrels following the winding-up of the firm, and was discovered in Blackburn in the early 1990s. The restored films now offer a unique social record of early 20th-century British life.[23]

Individual preservationists who have contributed to the cause include Robert A. Harris and James Katz (Lawrence of Arabia, My Fair Lady, and several Alfred Hitchcock films), Michael Thau (Superman), and Kevin Brownlow (Intolerance and Napoleon). Other organizations, such as the UCLA Film and Television Archive, have also preserved and restored films; a major part of UCLA's work includes such projects as Becky Sharp and select Paramount/Famous Studios and Warner Bros. cartoons whose credits were once altered due to rights taken over by different entities.

Studio efforts [ edit ]

In 1926 Will Hays asked for film studios to preserve their films by storing them at 40 degrees at low humidity in an Eastman Kodak process, so that "schoolboys in the year 3,000 and 4,000 A.D. may learn about us".[24]

Beginning in the 1970s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, aware that the original negatives to many of its Golden Age films had been destroyed in a fire, began a preservation program to restore and preserve all of its films by using whatever negatives survived, or, in many cases, the next best available elements (whether it be a fine-grain master positive or mint archival print). From the onset, it was determined that if some films had to be preserved, then it would have to be all of them. In 1986, when Ted Turner acquired MGM's library (which by then had included Warner Bros.' pre-1950,[25][nb 1] MGM's pre-May 1986, and a majority of the RKO Radio Pictures catalogs), he vowed to continue the preservation work MGM had started. Time Warner, the current owner of Turner Entertainment, continues this work today.

The cause for film preservation came to the forefront in the 1980s and early 1990s when such famous and influential film directors as Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese contributed to the cause. Spielberg became interested in film preservation when he went to view the master of his film Jaws, only to find that it had badly decomposed and deteriorated—a mere fifteen years after it had been filmed. Scorsese drew attention to the film industry's use of color-fading film stock through his use of black-and-white film stock in his 1980 film Raging Bull.[citation needed] His film, Hugo included a key scene in which many of film pioneer Georges Méliès' silent films are melted down and the raw material recycled as shoes; this was seen by many movie critics as "a passionate brief for film preservation wrapped in a fanciful tale of childhood intrigue and adventure."[26]

Scorsese’s concern about the need to save motion pictures of the past led him to create The Film Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation, in 1990. He was joined in this effort by fellow film makers who served on the foundation’s board of directors—Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford,and Steven Spielberg. In 2006, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Curtis Hanson, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee, and Alexander Payne were added to the board of directors of The Film Foundation, which is aligned with the Directors Guild of America.[citation needed]

By working in partnership with the leading film archives and studios, The Film Foundation has saved nearly 600 films, often restoring them to pristine condition. In many cases, original footage that had been excised—or censored by the Production Code in the U.S.—from the original negative, has been reinstated. In addition to the preservation, restoration, and presentation of classic cinema, the foundation teaches young people about film language and history through The Story of Movies, an educational program claimed to be "used by over 100,000 educators nationwide".[27]

In the age of digital television, high definition television and DVD, film preservation and restoration has taken on commercial as well as historical importance, since audiences demand the highest possible picture quality from digital formats. Meanwhile, the dominance of home video and ever-present need for television broadcasting content, especially on specialty cable channels, has meant that films have proven a source of long-term revenue to a degree that the original artists and studio management before the rise of these media never imagined. Thus media companies have a strong financial incentive to carefully archive and preserve their complete library of films.

Video Aids to Film Preservation [ edit ]

The group Video Aids to Film Preservation (VAFP) became active on the Internet in 2005.

The VAFP site was funded as part of a 2005 Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant to the Folkstreams project. The purpose of the site is to supplement already existing film preservation guides provided by the National Film Preservation Foundation with video demonstrations.[28] The preservation guides provided by the origination, while thoroughly depicting accurate methods of preservation, are mostly text-based. The films and clips are copyrighted under the Creative Commons license, which allows anyone to use these clips with attribution—in this case, attribution to the VAFP site and to the author of the clip and his company.

Obstacles in restoration [ edit ]

Damage to the film (caused by tears on the print, curling of the film base due to intense light exposure, temperature, humidity, etc.,) all significantly raise the difficulty of the preservation process. (Regardless of the age of the print itself, damage may occur if stored improperly.) Many films simply do not have enough information left on the film to piece together a new master, although careful digital restoration can produce stunning results by gathering bits and pieces of buildings from adjacent frames for restoration on a damaged frame, predicting entire frames based on the characters' movements in prior and subsequent frames, etc. As time goes on, this digital capability will only improve, but it will ultimately require sufficient information from the original film to make proper restorations and predictions.

Cost is another obstacle. In 2014, Martin Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, dedicated to film presentation, estimated the average cost of photochemical restoration of a color feature with sound at $50,000 to $100,000 dollars, with digital 2K or 4K restoration at "several hundred thousand dollars."[29] The degree of physical and chemical damage of film influences the incentive to preserve, i.e. as the business perspective states that once a film is no longer 'commercially' viable, it stops generating profit and becomes a financial liability. While few films would not benefit from digital restoration, the high cost of restoring films digitally still prevents the method from being as broadly applied as it might be.

Demand for new media, digital cinema, and constantly-evolving consumer digital formats keeps evolving and shifting. Film restoration facilities must keep pace to maintain audience acceptance. Classic films today must be in near-mint condition if they are to be reshown or resold, with the demand for perfection only rising as theaters move from 2K to 4K projection and consumer media continues its shift from SD to HD to UltraHD and beyond.[citation needed]

Digital restoration steps [ edit ]

Once a film is inspected and cleaned it is transferred via telecine or a motion picture film scanner to a digital tape or disk, and the audio is synced to create a new master.

The main defects needing restoration:

Dirt/dust

Scratches, tears/burned frames

Color fade, color change

Excessive film grain (a copy of an existing film has all of the film grain from the original as well as the film grain in the copy)

Missing scenes and sound (censored or edited out for re-release)

Shrinkage[nb 2]

Modern, digital film restoration takes the following steps:

Expertly clean the film of dirt and dust. Repair all film tears with clear polyester tape or splicing cement. Scan each frame into a digital file. Restore the film frame by frame by comparing each frame to adjacent frames. This can be done somewhat by computer algorithms with human checking of the result. Fix frame alignment ('jitter' and 'weave'), or the misalignment of adjacent film frames due to movement of film within the sprockets. This corrects the issue where the holes on each side of a frame are distorted over time. This causes frames to slightly be off center. Fix color and lighting changes. This corrects flickering and slight color changes from one frame to another due to aging of the film. Restore areas blocked by dirt and dust by using parts of images in other frames. Restore scratches by using parts of images in other frames. Enhance frames by reducing film grain noise. Film foreground/background detail about the same size as the film grain or smaller is blurred or lost in making the film. Comparing a frame with adjacent frames allows detail information to be reconstructed since a given small detail may be split between more film grains from one frame to another.

Photochemical restoration steps [ edit ]

Modern, photochemical restoration follows roughly the same path as digital:

Extensive research is done to determine what version of the film can be restored from the existing material. Often, extensive efforts are taken to search out alternate material in film archives located around the world. A comprehensive restoration plan is mapped that allows preservationists to designate elements as 'key' elements upon which to base the polarity map for the ensuing photochemical work. Since many alternative elements are actually salvaged from release prints and duplication masters (foreign and domestic). Care must be taken to plot the course at which negative, master positive and release print elements arrive back at a common polarity (i.e., negative or positive) for assembly and subsequent printing. Test prints are struck from existing elements to evaluate contrast, resolution, color (if color) and sound quality (if audio element exists). Elements are duplicated using the shortest possible duplication path to minimize analog duplication artifacts, such as the build-up of contrast, grain and loss of resolution. All sources are assembled into a single master restoration element (most often a duplicate negative). From this master restoration element, duplication masters, such as composite fine grain masters, are generated to be used to generate additional printing negatives from which actual release prints can be struck for festival screenings and DVD mastering.

Education [ edit ]

The practice of film preservation is more craft than science. Until the early 1990s there were no dedicated academic programs in film preservation. Practitioners had often entered the field through related education (e.g. library or archival science), related technical experience (e.g. film lab work), or driven by sheer passion for working with film.[30]

In the last two decades universities globally began offering graduate degrees in film preservation and film archiving, which are often taught conjointly (the latter focusing more on skills related to the description, cataloguing, indexing and broadly speaking management of film and media collections).

The recent years rapid incursion of digital technologies in the field has somewhat redefined the vocational scope of film preservation. In response, the majority of graduate programs in film preservation have begun offering courses on digital film preservation and digital film and media collection management.

Some established graduate programs in the field are:

Highly shrunken film (1.5% or higher), must be copied on modified equipment or the film will most likely be damaged in any equipment. In the case of inflammable nitrate film, this could prove to be dangerous.

Leaders in healthcare and technology to harness electrical signals in the body to treat chronic disease

GSK (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced an agreement with Verily Life Sciences LLC (formerly Google Life Sciences), an Alphabet company, to form Galvani Bioelectronics to enable the research, development and commercialisation of bioelectronic medicines. GSK will hold a 55% equity interest in the new jointly owned company and Verily will hold 45%.

Galvani Bioelectronics will be headquartered in the UK, with the parent companies contributing existing intellectual property rights[1] and an investment of up to £540 million over seven years, subject to successful completion of various discovery and development milestones.

Bioelectronic medicine is a relatively new scientific field that aims to tackle a wide range of chronic diseases using miniaturised, implantable devices that can modify electrical signals that pass along nerves in the body, including irregular or altered impulses that occur in many illnesses. GSK has been active in this field since 2012 and believes certain chronic conditions such as arthritis, diabetes and asthma could potentially be treated using these devices.

The agreement to establish Galvani Bioelectronics represents an important next step in GSK’s bioelectronics research. The new company will bring together GSK’s world class drug discovery and development expertise and deep understanding of disease biology with Verily’s world leading technical expertise in the miniaturisation of low power electronics, device development, data analytics and software development for clinical applications. Initial work will centre on establishing clinical proofs of principle in inflammatory, metabolic and endocrine disorders, including type 2 diabetes, where substantial evidence already exists in animal models; and developing associated miniaturised, precision devices.

Moncef Slaoui, GSK’s Chairman of Global Vaccines, who was instrumental in establishing GSK’s investments in the field of bioelectronics, will chair the board of the new company. He said:

“Many of the processes of the human body are controlled by electrical signals firing between the nervous system and the body’s organs, which may become distorted in many chronic diseases. Bioelectronic medicine’s vision is to employ the latest advances in biology and technology to interpret this electrical conversation and to correct the irregular patterns found in disease states, using miniaturised devices attached to individual nerves. If successful, this approach offers the potential for a new therapeutic modality alongside traditional medicines and vaccines.

“This agreement with Verily to establish Galvani Bioelectronics signals a crucial step forward in GSK’s bioelectronics journey, bringing together health and tech to realise a shared vision of miniaturised, precision electrical therapies. Together, we can rapidly accelerate the pace of progress in this exciting field, to develop innovative medicines that truly speak the electrical language of the body.”

Brian Otis, Verily’s Chief Technology Officer, said: “This is an ambitious collaboration allowing GSK and Verily to combine forces and have a huge impact on an emerging field. Bioelectronic medicine is a new area of therapeutic exploration, and we know that success will require the confluence of deep disease biology expertise and new highly miniaturised technologies.

“This partnership provides an opportunity to further Verily’s mission by deploying our focused expertise in low power, miniaturised therapeutics and our data analytics engine to potentially address many disease areas with greater precision with the goal of improving outcomes.”

Galvani Bioelectronics will be headquartered within GSK’s global R&D centre at Stevenage in the UK, with a second research hub at Verily’s facilities in South San Francisco. It will initially employ around 30 expert scientists, engineers and clinicians, and will fund and integrate a broad range of collaborations with both parent companies, academia and other R&D companies. GSK and Verily believe this collaborative way of working will rapidly accelerate the development of bioelectronic medicines.

Kris Famm, GSK’s Vice President of Bioelectronics R&D, has been appointed President of the new company. Famm has pioneered work in both large and small molecule drug discovery and worked for a decade developing and delivering R&D strategy with a recurring focus on emerging technologies. He has co-designed and led GSK’s exploration of bioelectronics. A seven-member board, chaired by Moncef Slaoui, will also be appointed and will include Andrew Conrad, CEO of Verily. The new company will be fully consolidated in GSK's financial statements.

This agreement is subject to customary closing conditions (including requisite antitrust approvals) and is expected to close before the end of 2016.

GSK and bioelectronics

Since 2012, a dedicated team of scientists at GSK has been researching the potential of bioelectronic medicines. In that time, the company has established a leadership position in the field, including creating a global network of around 50 research collaborations and investing $50m in a dedicated bioelectronics venture capital fund. Through these collaborations and investments, GSK has seen encouraging proof of principles in animal models in a range of diseases. It believes the first bioelectronic medicines could be ready for approval within the next decade.

The history of Galvani

Galvani Bioelectronics is named after Luigi Aloisio Galvani, an 18th century Italian scientist, physician and philosopher, who was one of the first to explore the field of bioelectricity. In 1780, he made the pivotal discovery that the muscles of a frog’s legs twitched when he touched the sciatic nerve with two pieces of metal, leading him to propose the theory of bioelectricity. Galvani’s discovery, while disputed by many of his peers, paved the way for the modern study of electrophysiology and neuroscience – two fields that are key to the development of bioelectronic medicines.

GSK – one of the world’s leading research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies – is committed to improving the quality of human life by enabling people to do more, feel better and live longer. For further information please visit www.gsk.com.

(CNN) In the past week I have seen flowers and candles carpeting a street in Munich , the tranquility of a small Bavarian town shattered by a suicide bomb and a small church in suburban France sealed off after its octogenarian priest had his throat cut .

Before these horrific events, there was a knife-wielding teenager on a German train . And before that, much deadlier attacks in Nice Brussels and last November, in Paris.

This year has seen an accelerating pattern of attacks linked to ISIS in Europe and beyond -- from Turkey to Bangladesh , the United States to Indonesia. According to the group IntelCenter, which tracks acts of terrorism, there has been a significant attack directed or inspired by ISIS every 84 hours since June 8 in cities outside the war zones in Iraq, Syria, Sinai in Egypt and Libya. CNN's own tracking of attacks supports that conclusion.

More than half of those attacks have been beyond big cities in places "not traditionally under threat of terrorist attacks," says IntelCenter. This rash of random, low-tech but deadly attacks has fueled public unease in Europe and eroded faith in governments to tackle the threat of terrorism or discern who might turn to violence.

It has also diminished trust in justice systems accused of leaving too many dangerous people at large. Despite twice trying to go to Syria, Adel Kermiche -- one of the 19-year-old attackers who killed the priest in France -- was released from custody and allowed out of his home for four hours a day. Despite repeated efforts to deport him, the Ansbach bomber -- Daleel Mohammad -- was still in Germany.

In my week-long journey across Northern Europe, that public unease was never far from the surface. Callers to German radio stations said they were apprehensive of visiting a mall. A shaken teacher who knew one of the attackers in France told CNN: "I never thought for a day in my life that a young person would commit a terrorist act here in Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray."

In Ansbach, a picturesque town in Bavaria, stunned locals drifted past the scene of the suicide bombing at a café, where abandoned drinks and playing cards bore silent witness to the moment of terror the night before.

These attacks have also prompted fundamental social questions. Respect for openness, liberal democracy and due process are being eaten away by a toxic mixture of extremism and psychosis.

Fear breeds civic distrust

Intelligence analysts Flashpoint Partners say there is "more coordination between potential lone actors or small unofficial cells with jihadi media -- a way to guarantee that their message is disseminated and to prove their allegiance to ISIS without necessarily joining its ranks."

The consistent public message from ISIS over the past year or so has been: "Don't come to Syria; kill the unbelievers at home."

These attacks, and the expectation of more, have fed not only the mood of growing anxiety. They have become part of a combustible political debate. I witnessed this in its rawest form at the site of the Munich killings. A young relative of one of the Turkish victims called out "Allahu Akhbar" in prayer, which was met by a torrent of abuse from some right-wingers present, provoking the Turks to yell "Your sisters will be next." Police moved in swiftly to keep the two groups apart.

In a poll after the attack in Nice, more than two-thirds of the French people questioned said they did not trust the government to combat terrorism effectively, a sharp increase over the previous year. Prime Minister Manuel Valls was booed by some of the crowd when he attended a memorial service for the victims.

"The government will have to answer the question: how flagged individuals, including one under judiciary control for attempting to wage jihad in Syria, were let free to commit such attacks?" asked former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, widely thought to be eying another bid for the top job next year.

France has deployed 4,000 troops in Paris; another 6,000 beyond. Bavarian Premier Horst Seehofer has called for similar measures in Germany.

But it seems even 100,000 troops could not guard against these random attacks.

The answer, to Sarkozy and others on the right, is internment without trial for anyone suspected of jihadist sympathies. It would be a dramatic departure from the cherished tradition of due process, but according to recent polls conducted for Le Figaro, such a move has the support of at least three-quarters of French citizens.

Is EU migration really linked to escalating terror?

JUST WATCHED Many Germans no longer want migrants in their country Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Many Germans no longer want migrants in their country 02:19

The outbreak of terror attacks in Northern Europe has also translated into growing hostility toward migration. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maziere pointed out that none of the recent attacks in Germany had been carried out by refugees who arrived last year. Nor was the attack in France. But that has not changed a perception among some that the tide of mass migration will end badly. The far-right Alternative fuer Deutschland party is polling at some 20% in Chancellor Angela Merkel's home state of Mecklenburg ahead of state elections in September.

Merkel has again insisted that "we can manage" the influx and integrate refugees into German society. A year ago her decision not to send would-be migrants back to their first point of entry into Europe led tens of thousands -- from Syria, Iraq and elsewhere -- to head for Germany. The slogan "Refugees Welcome" was on banners at city halls and football matches across Germany. It was a remarkable display of generosity toward those fleeing violence and persecution.

But the welcome has worn thin. Merkel is on the defensive . She -- like French President François Hollande -- must face the voters next year if she wants another term. Some within her own coalition now cry "We told you so" -- among them Bavarian Premier Seehofer.

Merkel has promised more decisive action to deport those whose requests fail and better detection of those becoming radicalized.

But the scale of the problem is enormous. According to German government statistics from March, about 400,000 asylum applications were still being processed. But half of those whose requests had been rejected -- nearly 170,000 people -- were still in Germany, among them Daleel Mohammad.

And sociologist Armin Nassehi, who examines migration issues at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, says many young male migrants are more vulnerable than most to manipulation or emotional instability.

"The central problem is that refugees have much more complicated life situations. They are people with traumatic experiences on the one hand and not knowing what will happen them to the future on the other," he told CNN.

Hard choices ahead

The core of the issue is this: how much is Europe prepared to compromise its way of life -- the freedoms and rights taken for granted for generations -- to do battle with random terrorism? How many public places become fortresses? How many events are canceled (as the French interior minister has recommended) if adequate security cannot be guaranteed? How much must be spent on the militarization of policing? And how many powers of arrest and detention should a government possess without reference to the courts? The state of emergency in France declared last November is set to run another three months at least.

As she visited the site of a makeshift memorial outside city hall in Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray on Wednesday, 23-year-old Meggy Simane paused for thought.

"It's a problem for everyone," she said, "the gay community amongst us, the Jewish communities, all walks of life. We are all different with our own cultures but at the same time we are all the same."

A 19-year old who lived just a few streets away from Meggy thought very differently.
Nelly’s debut album Country Grammar, released on June 27, 2000, was a Y2K staple with a curiously long shelf life. Attending college more than a decade after its original release, I recall hearing “Ride Wit Me” and “Country Grammar (Hot Shit)” at parties more times than I can count. On July 25, Country Grammar joined the ranks of Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP and OutKast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below as the eighth diamond-certified hip-hop album in history after moving ten million units in the U.S. If sales trends continue, it might be the last.

No hip-hop album released in the last decade is close to diamond certification. The closest, 50 Cent’s classic Get Rich or Die Tryin’ sits at roughly 8.4 million units shipped according to Billboard; it came out in February 2003. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (August 1998) follows that with less than eight million, and the drop off after that album is steep. The only hip-hop albums from this decade that are even in the same stratosphere are Eminem’s 2010 comeback album Recovery (4.7 million) and Lil Wayne’s 2008 blockbuster Tha Carter III (3.8 million), and that’s only if you consider “less than halfway there” close. The amount of time it takes for a rap album to hit diamond varies greatly; 2pac’s All Eyez On Me took 18 years, while OutKast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below made it in only three—largely because of a double-disc technicality—and MC Hammer’s Please Hammer, Don’t Hurt ‘Em achieved the certification in just one. However, it’s clear from the numbers that no rap album of the last decade is really on a diamond path.

Of course, album sales across genres have been falling for years now. Diamond has become increasingly out of reach for even the biggest artists. Adele’s 2011 album 21 managed to reach the milestone last year, and her 2015 follow-up 25 looks set to do the same in half the time, but, with her widespread appeal, Adele has been an unusual market force. Even Taylor Swift’s mega-smash 1989 only moved around six million copies, although its continued healthy sales pace of several thousand copies per week indicates that it has legs. Still, it’s not as if hip-hop is lacking in major stars with heavily promoted albums. Drake, Kanye West, Jay Z, Nicki Minaj, and Lil Wayne have all seen huge commercial success in the last decade, but none have managed to crack five million sold.

Is hip-hop simply suffering from a dearth of classic albums? Critically praised projects like Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, m.A.A.d. city, Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and Drake’s Take Care rule out that argument. But even with those albums’ passionate proselytizers and success on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the story remains the same: sales that fail to exceed 2-3 million units. It would seem that no matter the quality or the exposure, hip-hop’s sales have stalled out when it comes to mega-smash albums. According to Billboard, of the six albums released since 2001 that have moved at least eight million copies, only two have been rap albums; pop dominates the rest.

Part of this may be due to demographics. Adele and Taylor Swift appeal to Millennials and Baby Boomers in equal measure, with the latter generation being much more likely to purchase physical copies of an album. Hip-hop, on the other hand, skews much younger. A 2016 Entertainment Retail Association study found that Millennials listen to 75% more music than Baby Boomers, but are also much more likely to stream or pirate music than their older counterparts, lowering potential chart impact. Until recently, the RIAA didn’t even count streams toward album sales, ignoring the way many hip-hop consumers listen to music. Record labels are known to ship fewer physical copies of rap albums, prompting years of complaints from artists like 2 Chainz and Wale. Increasingly popular exclusive streaming deals also mean that many rap albums don’t see any physical release until weeks after the fact.

If anything is going to change this downward trajectory, it’s the RIAA’s new rules for calculating album sales, which counts 1,500 streams or 10 individual track purchases as one album sale. Drake’s VIEWS—by far the most commercially successful hip-hop album of 2016 is a poster child for streaming being a big part of its success. Almost 200,000 of its 1.1 million first week album sales came from streams, and its monster streaming numbers have helped VIEWS stay on top of the charts for months now despite technically being outsold in the traditional sense by several albums. According to Billboard, by its third week on the charts, streaming accounted for over half of VIEWS’ total consumption.

The real question is whether streaming will sustain an album’s sales numbers in the long run. Considering the RIAA’s streaming rules are so new, there’s not much precedent. It seems like streaming couldn’t possibly hurt, but more needs to be understood about how much it de-incentivizes purchasing. Streaming may expand the market to include people who would never have purchased the album in the first place, but if even a few of the people who streamed an album had purchased it instead, they would have a much greater impact on sales numbers. As the years go by, it will be interesting to see if streaming numbers continue to result in a similar sales trajectory that a hit album would normally enjoy, moving several thousand units per week for years after its initial release.

As far as sure-thing diamond certifications go these days, don’t hold your breath. Get Rich or Die Tryin’ could perhaps achieve the feat, but beyond that, the future looks bleak. Streaming represents a potential savior, but the longevity with which it will buoy album sales is far from certain. Unless something fundamentally changes about the way music is sold and distributed—or the RIAA moves the goalpost to a more attainable sales number—hip-hop may very well be looking at a diamond-less future. At least we’ll always have Country Grammar.
In 2011, President Obama announced an agreement made between 13 automakers to increase average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Now two government reports suggest that cheap fuel and a love of trucks may make that unlikely.

Both the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency have published draft reports which claim Obama’s 2011 promise currently looks out of reach. The agencies claim that a combination of sustained low fuel prices and an increasing popularity of trucks compared to cars. If things don’t change markedly, fuel economy might reach 50 miles per gallon at best.

The Corporate Average Fuel Economy program, the rules for which were tweaked in 2012, set a goal of 36.6 miles per gallon as an average fuel consumption for 2017 vehicles and a 54.5 miles-per-gallon average for 2025. While the former target looks set to be met, the 2025 figure looks less likely. That’s because forecasts were based on an assumption that demand for trucks would fall. But in fact, low fuel prices seem to have been increasing demand for light-duty trucks and SUVs, a trend that’s continued from last year.

If the auto industry is to right the trend, it will have to push cars with better fuel efficiencies upon buyers over the coming years. With a clear consumer desire for large vehicles and the electric car market still a relatively small and expensive slice of the automotive sector, though, manufacturers can’t rely on buyers actively switching to smaller, more efficient cars.

One approach is to drastically reduce the weight of larger vehicles. Traditionally that’s involved using aluminum or magnesium, but the decreasing cost of carbon fiber makes it an increasingly attractive automotive material. Smaller engines in the same trucks and SUVs could also go some way to helping, but smarter solutions such as ultra-efficient hybrid designs could maintain power output while reducing fuel consumption.

Automakers are, of course, already working on these technologies—they simply need to do a better job of selling them to consumers in the face of low fuel prices.

Is Your Sales Process Broken?

Let's be honest. Sales in a typical organization (most organizations in fact), is seriously broken. But rather than focusing on the obvious dysfunction, management is busy with incremental improvement initiatives:

Sales training Sales force automation (technology of various types) Bolt-on lead-generation activities (outsourced telemarketing, for example) New commission structures and incentives

Trouble is, none of these activities actually address the root cause of the dysfunction.

Sure, they may offer a temporary lift but things always go back to the way they were.
