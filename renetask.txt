Why are some women who want to support Gretchen Carlson in her sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News CEO Roger Ailes not speaking up publicly?

The answer involves strict non-disparagement clauses that some former Fox employees must sign.

In confidential interviews with CNNMoney, several women who formerly held on-air jobs at Fox said they believed Carlson's allegations and have stories of their own. But the women were reluctant to talk, citing the restrictive contract language.

Fox's parent company, 21st Century Fox, is conducting an internal review of the harassment allegations. These women said that the law firm conducting the internal review, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, had not reached out to them yet.

But that may be changing.

When contacted by CNNMoney on Saturday and Sunday, and asked how the review could be considered credible if the lawyers conducting it do not speak with the women, Fox declined to comment. The law firm did not respond to requests for comment.

On Monday, however, New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman reported that "the lawyers are seeking to interview former female employees of Fox News in addition to current staff."

Sherman also reported that the owners of 21st Century Fox, the Murdochs, "have decided to remove" Ailes, but have not determined exactly when or how.

CNN has not independently verified the report.

In a statement responding to Sherman's report, 21st Century Fox pointedly did not rule out corporate action against Ailes, but said such action would be premature.

"This matter is not yet resolved and the review is not concluded," the statement said.

In the days since the lawsuit was filed, more than a dozen Fox hosts have stood up for Ailes in interviews and statements. That may have suggested to observers that there are far more people ready to support Ailes than Carlson.

But the non-disparagement clauses are a complicating factor.

In one instance, a former Fox commentator posted a comment on Facebook that supported Carlson -- and called Ailes a "dirty old fart" -- but said she took it down due to the non-disparagement clause.

In another case, a former Fox reporter consulted a lawyer before speaking with CNNMoney on condition of anonymity. "I think there are many people who've had the same experience Gretchen is describing," the former reporter said.

The reporter described repeated instances of harassment by Ailes and said "Roger often took verbal liberties with female employees," but would not go into any more detail, citing the non-disparagement clause.

Ailes has said Carlson's allegations are false. The two sides are now battling through court filings.

Non-disparagement clauses affect former employees who sign a "separation agreement" on the way out.

The legal language is meant to protect Fox News from criticism and keep things cordial between ex-employee and ex-employer. It can be enforced through reminder letters from lawyers and, in rare cases, breach of contract lawsuits.

Other TV networks and other types of employers also use non-disparagement clauses. But according to a talent agent, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, there are at least two things that make Fox's deals especially restrictive.

In at least some cases, the clauses are worded to protect not just Fox, but "senior management," including Ailes. And "the mere acknowledgment that it exists would violate the terms of it," the agent said.

So unless the former employees are freed from the legal language, they may be limited in what they can say — to reporters and to lawyers.

"It's probably fair to say that you can't get a real, accurate investigation based on the existence of these clauses," said another industry executive who has seen the legal language in Fox's contracts.

Some critics of Fox have already expressed doubt about the legitimacy of the review. "This is a law firm that represents giant corporate entities," sexual harassment lawyer and advocate Lisa Bloom said on "CNN Tonight" on July 11. She asserted that the investigation is "almost certainly going to be skewed in favor of Fox News."

In addition to any legal reasons, former employees have reputational reasons to avoid commenting. Fox's hardball tactics are legendary in the television business. In the past, Ailes and his public relations staffers have attacked ex-hosts like Paula Zahn and even leaked unflattering information about current hosts and reporters.

The P.R. department has changed hands in recent years, but memories of the tactics loom large.

"Roger Ailes casts a long shadow," a former Fox producer said.

At the same time, Ailes is also admired by past and present staffers for his television production and management acumen. Blunt, politically incorrect talk is part of his appeal among some staffers.

Several of them, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ailes is well known for making inappropriate comments, and they thought Carlson overreacted by suing.

A former Fox host remembered Ailes saying to her, "Walk down the hallway slower, I want to get a look at those legs." But she said she did not consider that to be sexual harassment, and she praised Ailes at length.

Others, however, said they believed Ailes crossed a line, but said they could not be quoted describing their experiences, even when promised anonymity.

Police in New Hampshire's largest city have gotten the Pokemon Go bug, trying to lure fugitives with the popular app.

A post on the Manchester Police Department Facebook page announces that police recently detected one of the more rare Pokemon characters — a Charizard — in the booking area. The post invites those whose names appear on a list linked to the post to be "one of the lucky ones" to come capture the Charizard.

The list includes the names of the more than 500 fugitives on the department's wanted persons roundup.



Sgt. Eric Knight said Sunday the post has yet to net an arrest. But it's been popular with its Facebook followers.

Since the post went up late Saturday night, it's captured more than 13,000 "likes."
The new system bears many similarities to Tesla’s Autopilot, which is under investigation by U.S. regulators for three recent accidents.

With Tesla’s Autopilot under intense scrutiny, it seems like a strange time to launch an autonomous driving feature. But that’s exactly what Nissan has done, unveiling its new ProPilot system less than two weeks after we learned of the first fatal autonomous Tesla crash.

Nissan’s system, which will be available on new Serena minivan models in Japan as soon as next month, is able to take control of accelerating, braking, and steering. The automaker claims that it can handle highway driving as well as stop-and-go traffic in a single lane.

Much like Tesla’s Autopilot, the system is reported to use an onboard camera and image-processing software to recognize vehicles and road markings. The system controls the position of the car relative to the vehicle in front, while driving at speeds between 20 mph and 60 mph.

Nissan’s executive vice president, Hideyuki Sakamoto, has been quick to point out the limitations of the technology, explaining that “these functions are meant to support drivers, and are not meant as self-driving capabilities." The point isn’t to be able to take your hands off the wheel, according to Nissan—though that is possible.

Like Tesla’s system, when the driver removes their hands from the wheel, a warning is shown on the dashboard. However, unlike Autopilot, ProPilot will deactivate if the driver doesn’t replace their hands upon the wheel after several seconds. That final feature may prove to be a strength for ProPilot in the eyes of regulators.

Three Tesla crashes involving Autopilot are now under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, though only one proved fatal. In that incident, the driver was killed when his car hit the side of truck that the autonomous system failed to detect. Data from the vehicle suggests none of the car’s controls were used by the driver immediately before impact.

The recent events surrounding Tesla’s Autopilot make it an awkward time to roll out an autonomous driving features of any kind. Over the coming weeks, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board will consider evidence regarding the recent crashes—potentially publishing guidelines that shape the future of self-driving cars.

Embed Melania Trump's Speech Appears to Be Plagiarized 4:13 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

CLEVELAND, Ohio — A chunk of Melania Trump's Republican National Convention speech appears to have been lifted from Michelle Obama's address at the 2008 Democratic convention.

Trump said on the TODAY Show that she wrote the speech largely on her own, telling host Matt Lauer that: "I read once over it, and that's all. Because I wrote it…with as little help as possible."

Her emotional address to GOP delegates on Monday night sought to show her husband's softer side, a star turn that quickly drew glowing praise.

Then a journalist pointed out the striking similarities — almost word for word at points — to the first lady's speech from 2008, and a plagiarism controversy exploded.

A two-paragraph section of Trump's speech about family values bears nearly identical phrasing to Obama's 2008 address, which was seen as a breakout moment for the future first lady and a humanizing moment for her husband.

"My parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life. That your word is your bond, and you do what you say and keep your promise. That you treat people with respect," Trump told delegates about halfway through her speech Monday night.

Compare that to Obama's, which said: "Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them."

Trump went on to emphasize the need to "pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow, because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and the willingness to work for them."

It's a near mirror of the next line in Obama's speech: "We want our children — and all children in this nation — to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them."

In a rare point of GOP and Democratic unity, the reaction to the two speeches was similar as well: Republicans cheered the same lines their Democratic counterparts cheered years before.

The reaction to the apparent plagiarism was swift: Twitter erupted and the hashtag #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes — poking fun at the candidate's wife by attributing others' historic sayings to her — was trending worldwide.

"Work, work, work, work, work, work

He say me have to

Work, work, work, work, work, work!" #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes — jesseWilliams. (@iJesseWilliams) July 19, 2016

I have a dream. #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes — Kate Dahlstrand (@KateDahls) July 19, 2016

Trump convention manager Paul Manafort responded to the controversy on CNN on Tuesday morning, saying "there is no cribbing of Michelle Obama's speech."

"These were common words and values, and she cares about her family," Manafort said. "To think that she would do something like that, knowing how scrutinized her speech was going to be last night, is just really absurd."

The Trump campaign release a statement early Tuesday that did not directly address the allegations.

"In writing her beautiful speech, Melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking," Trump senior communications advisor Jason Miller said in the statement. "Melania's immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success."

That has done little to stem the flood of criticism, which already has marred what was Trump's first foray back onto the campaign trail in months.

She was one of an array of Trump family members set to deliver primetime speeches during the Republican National Convention. Aides hope the speeches will help show the softer side of a brash candidate who holds the lowest approval ratings of a major party nominee in history.

Sarah Hurwitz, Michelle's head speechwriter, used to be Hillary's. So the Trump campaign plagiarized from a Hillary speechwriter. — Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) July 19, 2016

Charges of plagiarism are nothing new in politics — but when they arise, they often have a significant, negative impact on the plagiarizer's political hopes.

Vice President Joe Biden dropped out of the 1988 presidential race after he admitted to plagiarizing part of a paper he wrote in law school; Montana Sen. John Walsh, a Democrat, ended his reelection bid after less than a year in office because he was found to have lifted chunks of his master's thesis.

With Trump surrogates blanketing the RNC festivities all week, the plagiarism charges pose another issue the campaign and GOP leadership will need to tackle before the week ends and Trump is officially crowned the party's nominee.
The deleted tweet archive PostGhost is shutting down after receiving a notice from Twitter, the site announced.

PostGhost argued the public has a right to see the tweets

PostGhost, which had just launched this week, kept copies of tweets sent by verified users with more than 10,000 followers. In Twitter's letter, posted by PostGhost, the company said that recording deleted tweets was a violation of the service's terms. PostGhost agreed to comply and shut down, but in a lengthy response, argued that such users are "public figures" that should have their tweets recorded.

"We believe that for such prominent verified Twitter users, the public has a right to see their public Twitter history, whether or not they grow to regret the statements they've made," PostGhost's statement reads.

Twitter has made clear before that similar services violate the company's terms. In the most prominent case so far, Politwoops, a project made to archive the tweets of politicians, was shut down, only later to be revived. The two have since seemed to reach an understanding.

The PostGhost shutdown, then, is an interesting case study in where Twitter is drawing the line, recognizing that holding politicians accountable may be a public service worthy of bending the rules, even as it declines to do the same for other prominent users.

Please click HERE to view a video on Access to Solar Panels featuring President Obama

President Obama is committed to ensuring that every American family can choose to go solar and to cut their energy bills – and that every American community has the tools they need to tackle local air pollution and global climate change.

Since President Obama took office, solar electricity generation has increased 30 fold and solar jobs are growing 12 times faster than the rest of the economy. Last year, we announced a set of actions to increase access to solar and create a more inclusive workforce, but there is still more work to do. That is why, today, the Obama Administration is announcing a new cross government partnership – the Clean Energy Savings For All Initiative – between the Departments of Energy (DOE), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Agriculture (USDA), Health and Human Services (HHS), Veteran’s Affairs (VA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to increase access to solar energy and promote energy efficiency across the United States and, in particular in low- and moderate- income communities.

Through the Clean Energy Savings for All Initiative, the Administration will work to ensure that every household has options to choose to go solar and put in place additional measures to promote energy efficiency. To continue along this track, the Administration, in collaboration with state agencies, is announcing a new catalytic goal to bring 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar to low- and moderate- income families by 2020. This goal is a 10 fold increase and an expansion of the initial target President Obama set in his Climate Action Plan to install 100 MW of renewable energy on federally-assisted affordable housing by 2020. The Clean Energy Savings for All Initiative will help achieve the goal by promoting innovative financing mechanisms, bolstering technical assistance for states and communities, driving innovation, scaling up workforce training to make sure low- and moderate-income Americans can take advantage of the jobs that come with a transition to clean energy, convening stakeholders, and working with the private and philanthropic sectors. The key components of the initiative that the Administration is announcing today are:

HUD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are releasing new guidance to unlock residential Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing by outlining how properties with PACE assessments can be purchased and refinanced with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance and by welcoming the use of PACE financing for Veterans Affairs (VA)-insured mortgages. In addition, DOE is releasing a draft of their updated Best Practices Guidelines for Residential PACE Financing for public comment. PACE is a tool that allows American homeowners, including low- and moderate- income households and veterans, to finance solar and energy efficiency improvements at no upfront cost and to pay back the cost over time through their property tax bill;

DOE is developing a Community Solar Challenge that will award teams in dozens of communities up to $100,000, in cash prizes and technical assistance, to develop innovative models to increase solar deployment and cut communities’ energy bills, in particular in low income communities;

HHS and DOE are making it easier to use hundreds of millions of dollars for energy efficiency improvements by providing technical assistance to Low Income Housing Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) grantees on their ability to access 15 – 25 percent of their annual LIHEAP funding for low cost energy efficiency improvements, including renewable energy;

DOE is making sure low- and moderate-income Americans can take advantage of the jobs that come with a transition to clean energy by launching the Solar Training Network, which will help create a more inclusive workforce by connecting solar workforce trainers, solar employers, and individuals interested in working in the solar industry;

EPA, DOE, and HUD are bringing people together to share best practices on how to finance and overcome barriers to creating healthier communities; and

More than 120 housing authorities, rural electric co-ops, power companies, and organizations in more than 36 states across the country are committing to investing $287 million and putting in place more than 280 megawatts (MW) of solar energy projects, including projects to help low- and moderate- income communities save on their energy bills and further the deployment of community solar.

The announcements today will result in lower energy bills, more empowered consumers, and cleaner communities.

EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO SCALE UP SOLAR AND REDUCE ENERGY BILLS

To continue supporting all American communities in deploying renewable energy while creating jobs and reducing carbon pollution, the Administration is announcing the following actions:

Supporting the Scale Up of Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing: Since 2009, the Obama Administration has been working to provide homeowners the opportunity to finance solar and energy efficiency improvements at no upfront cost through a mechanism called PACE, including through the Middle Class Taskforce and by releasing a Policy Framework for PACE Financing Programs. Today, the Obama Administration is taking a number of new actions to allow American homeowners, including low- and moderate- income households and veterans to use PACE financing. This innovative financing mechanism allows homeowners to benefit from energy improvements immediately and pay back the cost over time through their property taxes. If the property is sold, including through foreclosure, the remaining PACE assessment will stay with the more energy efficient property and the next owner will become responsible for the remaining PACE assessment. The PACE initiatives announced today will unlock alternative sources of capital for low- and moderate- income Americans and veterans to scale up solar, promote energy and water efficiency retrofits, and create more resilient homes, leading to reduced energy bills, more empowered consumers, and cleaner communities.

Issuing Guidance on how to Use FHA Mortgage Insurance with PACE Financing: For more than 80 years, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has provided low- and moderate- income households and underserved communities access to safe and affordable housing through FHA mortgage insurance. Each day, more than 3,000 people close on a home for which the mortgage is insured by FHA. Today, FHA is releasing guidance outlining how properties with PACE assessments can be purchased and refinanced with an FHA-insured mortgage. This action is intended to support renewable energy and energy efficiency investments in single family housing, support retrofits that boost resilience to climate risks, and remove existing barriers to using PACE financing. The key requirements outlined in FHA’s guidance are: the PACE assessment does not take first lien position ahead of the mortgage and the assessment transfers from one property owner to the next, including through a foreclosure sale. The guidance also requires appraisers to analyze and report on the impact of PACE-related improvements to the value of the property.

Providing Best Practices for New and Existing Residential PACE Programs throughout the Country: DOE is releasing a draft of their updated Best Practices Guidelines for Residential PACE Financing for public comment from stakeholders, including consumer advocates, public policy leaders, and industry. This public comment period is critical to ensuring the highest levels of consumer and lender protections. Across the nation, fifteen states have already adopted residential PACE-enabling legislation. Overall, nearly 100,000 households have utilized PACE programs to finance over $2 billion in energy saving improvements to their homes. The updated guidelines reflect the evolving structure of the PACE market and incorporate lessons learned from various PACE programs that have been successfully implemented since the original guidelines were issued. They provide best practices for residential PACE programs, including protections to both consumers who voluntarily opt into PACE programs, and to lenders who hold mortgages on properties with PACE assessments. The guidelines can also be used by PACE program administrators, contractors and consumers to plan, develop and implement programs and improvements that effectively deliver home energy and related upgrades. DOE’s updated Best Practice Guidelines for Residential PACE Financing rely upon important progress that the Department has made in a critical partnership with industry, including a formal partnership with the Appraisal Foundation to develop guidance on valuation of energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings that was launched in 2011. DOE is also partnering with the Appraisal Institute to integrate energy efficiency into appraisals and real estate transactions and deliver education and training to appraisers through the Better Buildings Home Energy Information Accelerator, where they have enlisted the support of the Real Estate Standards Organization, the Council of MLS, Homes.com, and National Association of Realtors.

Providing Technical Assistance to Make it Easier for States and Communities to Stand Up Smart PACE Programs: DOE will provide technical assistance to support the design and implementation of effective PACE programs, including conducting a series of webinars and online workshops to facilitate peer exchange and provide access to PACE experts; conducting research on the lessons learned from state and local residential PACE programs , including analysis of the impact of PACE on community adoption rates of energy efficiency improvements and per household energy consumption, and various program design strategies, and effectiveness of PACE relative to other financing mechanisms. DOE is also working with State Energy Offices, local government representatives, residential PACE industry representatives, and subject matter experts to focus on residential PACE program design (including consumer protection options) and the development and dissemination of detailed program best practices.

Developing a Community Solar Challenge: To help meet the Administration’s 1 GW goal, DOE is announcing the development of a Community Solar Challenge that will award teams in dozens of communities up to $100,000 to develop innovative models to increase solar deployment and cut communities’ energy bills, in particular in low-income communities. Today, the DOE SunShot Initiative is releasing a request for information to gather feedback and information on the structure of challenge. Shared solar systems of 2 megawatts (MW) or less with 40 percent low- and moderate- income subscribers, solar systems that benefit low-income families, and solar for community assets, e.g., hospitals, schools, food banks, and health clinics will be eligible. This challenge will reduce market barriers to solar deployment by spurring the deployment of dozens of projects across the nation, with an emphasis on new and emerging solar markets.

Making it Easier for Low Income Households to Access Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Funding for Renewable Energy Investments: The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides, on average more than $3 billion a year to communities across the country and includes a provision that allows LIHEAP grantees to access 15 - 25 percent of their annual funding for low cost weatherization and energy efficiency improvements. Today, we are announcing technical assistance to LIHEAP grantees to increase their ability to use this funding to support the deployment of renewable energy.

Tracking the Deployment of Solar on Low- and Moderate Income Households: DOE, in collaboration with HUD and GTM Research, will work with the national labs to track progress on the deployment of solar energy for low- and moderate- income households, in particular to reach the Administration’s 1 GW goal.

Providing Technical Assistance to Make it Easier for More Americans to Participate in the Clean Energy Economy: Today, the Administration is announcing three actions to ensure all communities have the information they need to participate in the clean energy economy.

Creating a Resource Hub to Promote Energy Access: DOE is creating a cross-agency digital hub on the Solar Powering America website so that communities, businesses, organizations and state and local governments can learn about federal resources to help low- and moderate-income Americans go solar.

Today, DOE, the City of Baltimore and the Maryland Clean Energy Center signed a Memorandum of Understanding intended to accelerate the growth of and access to solar and renewable energy jobs and to prepare a roadmap for rapid demonstration and deployment.

STATE AND PRIVATE SECTOR COMMITMENTS TO INCREASE SOLAR ENERGYAND CUT ENERGY BILLS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS AMERICA

To help us achieve our new goal to bring 1 GW of solar energy to low- and moderate- income families by 2020, today, the Administration is announcing more than 120 new commitments from the private, state, local, and philanthropic sectors in 36 states to support the deployment of solar energy in low-and moderate income communities and promote community solar and energy efficiency. Today’s new commitments represent $287 million in investment, and nearly 280 MW of community solar and low-and moderate income solar deployment. They bring the total amount of commitments secured to more than $800 million in investment and more than 491 MW of solar power. These announcements include:

Growing The Reach And Impact Of The National Community Solar Partnership by 6 Fold: Last July, the Administration launched the National Community Solar Partnership—a collaborative effort between the DOE, HUD, USDA, EPA, representatives from solar companies, NGOs, and state and community leaders —which works to unlock access to solar for the nearly 50 percent of households and businesses that are renters or do not have adequate roof space to install solar systems, in particular, for low- and moderate- income communities. Since we launched the partnership last year, more than 110 companies, organizations, and universities that represent 25 states have joined the effort to increase access to community solar, growing the number of members by six fold to 135, including the following 67 new partners joining today:
Canada will implement a national policy to charge polluters for emitting carbon dioxide by the end of the year, a top government official said.

Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment minister, told Bloomberg TV Canada that the goal of the policy is a uniform national carbon price, along with new requirements for companies to disclose emissions.

“What we want to see is uniformity in terms of a national price, also that we’re doing it in a thoughtful way, and provinces and territories need to decide what they’re doing with the revenues,” she said.

Four provinces representing about 80 percent of Canada’s population currently have some kind of carbon pricing policies, which usually consist of either a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system.

Asked whether her pledge means that provinces and territories without a tax currently would be forced to implement one, McKenna told Bloomberg, “I don’t like the word forced. I think this is really an opportunity.”

“We need a national price on carbon,” she said. “So that’s what we’re going to have in the fall.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met in March with the leaders of all of the provinces and territories, and asked them to propose by October climate plans for their jurisdictions that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Trudeau, a member of the Liberal party, came to power last year, replacing Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Harper had resisted wide-ranging climate policies, and Trudeau’s party was elected in part due to its promise to take climate more seriously.
Google just paid for part of its acquisition of DeepMind in a surprising way.

The internet giant is using technology from the DeepMind artificial intelligence subsidiary for big savings on the power consumed by its data centers, according to DeepMind Co-Founder Demis Hassabis.

In recent months, the Alphabet Inc. unit put a DeepMind AI system in control of parts of its data centers to reduce power consumption by manipulating computer servers and related equipment like cooling systems. It uses a similar technique to DeepMind software that taught itself to play Atari video games, Hassabis said in an interview at a recent AI conference in New York.

The system cut power usage in the data centers by several percentage points, "which is a huge saving in terms of cost but, also, great for the environment," he said.

The savings translate into a 15 percent improvement in power usage efficiency, or PUE, Google said in a statement. PUE measures how much electricity Google uses for its computers, versus the supporting infrastructure like cooling systems.

Google said it used 4,402,836 MWh of electricity in 2014, equivalent to the average yearly consumption of about 366,903 U.S. family homes. A significant proportion of Google’s spending on electricity comes from its data centers, which support its globe-spanning web services and mobile apps.

Saving a few percentage points of electricity usage means major financial gains for Google. Typical electricity prices companies pay in the U.S. range from about $25 to $40 per MWh, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. (Prices in different regions range from a few dollars to more than $100). Either way, saving 10 percent on data center power consumption, for instance, could translate to hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for Google over multiple years. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for 400 million pounds, or more than $600 million at the time, according to The Guardian.

The application of DeepMind’s technology builds on previous efforts by Google to apply machine learning, a type of AI, to its data centers. Back in 2014, the company said it used neural networks, a type of pattern recognition system, to predict how its power usage would change over time, letting it arrange equipment in more efficient ways.

The DeepMind work goes a step further. Instead of making moves in an Atari game, the software changes how equipment runs inside the data centers to get the highest score -- in this case more efficient consumption of electricity.

"It controls about 120 variables in the data centers. The fans and the cooling systems and so on, and windows and other things," Hassabis said. "They were pretty astounded."

This is just the beginning of the project, Hassabis said. Now that DeepMind knows the approach works, it also knows where its AI system lacks information, so it may ask Google to put additional sensors into its data centers to let its software eke out even more efficiency.

Researchers working in the Netherlands have developed an atomic-scale rewritable data-storage device capable of packing 500 terabits onto a single square inch. Incredibly, that’s enough to store every book written by humans on a surface the size of a postage stamp. Holy shit.



It is as if we have invented the atomic scale printing press.

This atomic hard drive, developed by Sander Otte and his colleagues at Delft University, features a storage density that’s 500 times larger than state-of-the-art hard disk drives. At 500 terabits per square inch, it has the potential to store the entire contents of the US Library of Congress in a 0.1-mm wide cube. The new system, described in the latest issue of Nature Nanotechnology, still requires considerable work before it’s ready for prime time, but it’s an important proof-of-principle that lays the groundwork for the development of useable atomic-scale data storage devices.

This isn’t the first time scientists have positioned individual atoms at will. Researchers have been moving atoms using scanning tunneling microscopes since the early 1990s, but current methods are tedious and show, requiring tremendous patience and persistence. The new system, while still a bit slow, is a huge improvement in user friendliness.

To make it work, Otte and team placed chlorine atoms on a copper surface, resulting in a perfect square grid. Importantly, a hole appears on this grid whenever an atom is missing. As we all know, this type of on/off type configuration lends itself well to binary switching—the foundation of digital data storage. Using the sharp needle of a scanning tunneling microscope, the researchers were able to probe the atoms one by one, and even drag individual atoms towards a hole.

“The combination of chlorine atoms and supporting copper crystal surface that we found now, combined with the fact that we manipulate ‘holes’—just as in a sliding puzzle—makes for a much more reliable, reproducible and scalable manipulation technique that can easily be automated,” explained Otte to Gizmodo. “It is as if we have invented the atomic scale printing press.”

The comparison to a sliding puzzle is apt. Every bit consists of two positions on a surface of copper atoms, and one chlorine atom that can be adjusted back and forth between these two positions. When a chlorine atom is in the top position, and there’s a hole beneath it, it’s a 1. Reversed, the bit is a 0. Voila, instant hard drive.

Each chlorine atom is surrounded by other chlorine atoms, which helps keep them in place, except near the holes. This method makes it much more stable than methods that use loose atoms. Using this technique, the researchers were able to perform write, read-out, and re-write operations in a one-kilobyte device comprising 8,000 atomic bits. It is by far the largest atomic structure ever constructed by humans.

The researchers organized memory into blocks of 8 bytes (64 bits). Each of these blocks was assigned a marker, constructed from the same types of “holes” as the raster of chlorine atoms. Similar to QR codes, these markers function like miniature barcodes that carry information about the precise location of their block on the copper layer. These markers can also indicate when a block is damaged, say on account of a local contaminant or an error on the surface. This means that memory can be easily scaled up to a big size, even if there are physical deficiencies in the copper surface.



An excerpt from Richard Feynman’s lecture, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.” (Image: Sander Otte et al., 2016/Nature Nanoscience)

During the experiment, the researchers preserved the positions of more than 8,000 chlorine “vacancies,” or missing atoms, for more than 40 hours at 77 kelvin (more on this in just a bit). After developing a binary alphabet based on the positions of the holes, the researchers stored various texts, including physicist Richard Feynman’s seminal lecture, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” and Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species. This data was stored atom by atom, bit by bit, on the surface of the copper sheet. The ensuing write/re-write speed was relatively slow—on the scale of minutes—but the demonstration showed that it’s possible to reliably write, store, and read data at the atomic scale.

“While the memory outperforms existing media by far in terms of capacity, it still stays far behind in terms of read/write speed,” Otte told Gizmodo. “However, I foresee no physical boundaries that will prevent us from speeding up these processes to similar speeds that are currently seen in [hard disk drives]. It will be a technological challenge for sure, but in terms of physics it should work.”

I cannot at this point foresee where this will lead, but I am convinced that it will be much more exciting than just data storage.

An important caveat, however, is that this system cannot function in an everyday environment. In its current form, the atomic hard drive can only operate in clean vacuum conditions and at liquid nitrogen temperatures, which is -346°F (-210°C). As Otte admits, “the actual storage of data on an atomic scale is still some way off,” but “through this achievement we have certainly come a big step closer.”

The fact that this system only works at liquid nitrogen temperatures may seem like a deal breaker, but Otte disagrees. Now that his team has found that this particular combination of chlorine and copper provides a balance in terms of stability and manipulability, a logical next step would be to look for similar but different atoms such as iodine or bromine, and see if that enhances stability and thereby operating temperature.

“But even if that would not work, it would not be inconceivable to have data storage solutions at nitrogen temperatures in larger data centers,” Otte said. “Many MRI scanners in hospitals are kept at helium temperature permanently, so in that sense it is not as extreme as it may sound at first.”

Otte also sees this as a general breakthrough in the field of nanotechnology, saying it’s really just a demonstration of our new abilities to engineer the world on the smallest possible length scale. “I cannot at this point foresee where this will lead, but I am convinced that it will be much more exciting than just data storage,” he said.

We traveled to South Africa to show you the new, critical research — led by Seattle scientists — that could wipe out HIV. Thousands of volunteers are being recruited to enroll in clinical trials.

This is the second of a two-part series about efforts in South Africa to wipe out HIV. Read Part 1

CAPE TOWN, South Africa — It was the question on everybody’s mind. “I know there’s a rumor that the vaccine can infect us. What do you say about that?”

The young man was at a May event in Soweto publicizing two new HIV-prevention studies, including one testing a vaccine. Both are being conducted by an international network headquartered at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Busi Buthelezi, the emcee, jumped in. As long as she and other community advisers to the studies are standing, she said, “It will never happen … Never.”

No one, of course, talked about the network’s last big HIV-vaccine study.

The devastating news came in 2007. Participants in a highly promising clinical trial who got that experimental vaccine were getting HIV at a higher rate than those receiving the placebo. The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) study was taking place in North and South America and Australia, while a parallel trial was starting in South Africa.

Scientists stopped the studies, but they didn’t know what had gone wrong. They still don’t.

In South Africa, “There was a big backlash,” said Dr. Wolfgang Preiser, professor of medical virology at Cape Town’s Stellenbosch University. He recalled the country’s health minister at the time saying it was “unacceptable” for scientists to come to South Africa and put participants at risk.

Even so, “I think the investigators were far more blown away than the participants,” said Dr. Linda-Gail Bekker, one of the leading South African scientists involved in the network’s research. “You warned us,” she said the participants acknowledged, referring to the unpredictability of science.

Researchers’ sense that they could cause harm “changed how we do business,” said Bekker, who is deputy director of Cape Town’s Desmond Tutu HIV Centre. This time, independent monitors will check results more frequently and call things off sooner, if necessary.

Meeting at a bakery in a verdant Cape Town suburb, encompassing a rugby field and gracious, walled-in homes, Bekker was upbeat. The night before, she was on a conference call with key figures in the upcoming vaccine trial, including Seattle-based HVTN scientists Dr. Larry Corey and Dr. Julie McElrath. Everyone agreed: Preliminary results from a small, ongoing safety trial of the vaccine were uniformly positive. The big trial planned for November was on.

“It’s a wonderful story,” Bekker said.

And a surprising one.

Frustration, then promise

In the early 2000s, a research division of the U.S. military and the Thai government embarked on an HIV-vaccine study in Thailand. Expectations were low.

“Since the late ’80s, trying for a vaccine has been a frustrating scientific endeavor,” said Corey, who helped develop the breakthrough HIV drug AZT. He went on to become president of Fred Hutch and returned to AIDS research as an HVTN principal investigator in 2014.

Results from the Thai trial, announced in 2009, were more positive than anything that had come before: 31 percent efficacy.

“We spent a lot of time trying to figure out why,” said Corey.

What Fred Hutchinson’s McElrath and colleagues around the world subsequently discovered is that previous test vaccines had done “exactly what not to do,” Corey said. Those vaccines had eliminated a part of the virus that helped stimulate the immune system.

Still, the Thai results were mediocre; the goal is at least 50 percent effectiveness. So researchers went back to the lab to create a better vaccine, one suited for the place where it is needed most — southern Africa, which has a different HIV subtype than Thailand.

The trial soon to start in South Africa will add a shot, making for five injections instead of four over the course of a year, and will incorporate a new substance meant to boost the immune response.

All the while, scientists, including at Fred Hutch, have separately been studying people who have what are known as “broadly neutralizing antibodies.” These people are infected with HIV, yet the disease does not progress. Corey calls their antibodies, which resist various subtypes of HIV, the “holy grail” of the HIV vaccine quest.

In the last five or six years, he said, scientists developed technologies to fish out these antibodies. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did so with one antibody, which has since been copied numerous times to make an infusion given through an IV drip to participants of two trials in Africa and the Americas.

Corey concedes the 30- to 60-minute procedure, given every couple of months in the antibody mediated prevention studies, is impractical. And that’s why no product is expected any time soon.

But if the trials show the procedure works, he said, maybe scientists could develop an infusion that lasts for six months, or 12, or even years at a time.

Better yet, he said, maybe they could work backward and design a vaccine to stimulate these antibodies.

Dr. Francois Venter, deputy executive director of Wits Reproductive Health & HIV Institute, is not holding his breath. Although his Johannesburg institute is one site for the antibody study, he stressed that vaccine development takes time. Mathematical modeling shows “The point from finding it works to seeing it having a public-health impact is 15 years,” he said. “The 15-year push button hasn’t even started yet.”

That, and a string of failed trials over 16 years, is why Stellenbosch’s Preiser said the vaccine field “is not very sexy at the moment.”

Aware of the skepticism, HVTN has kept publicity about the trials relatively low-key, although the network plans to discuss them at the 21st International AIDS Conference in Durban, which begins Monday.

“We do operate under the radar,” said Dr. Glenda Gray, a principal investigator with the network as well as president of the South African Medical Research Council. Yet Gray could not resist some optimism. “At the end of five years, we will have so much information.”

New “young lions”

“Calling Fred Hutch.” The words came up on the front-door buzzer system at a sleek building in a Cape Town development with stunning views of Table Mountain, home to lawyers’ offices, an Amazon call center and a food court serving tapas and sushi.

At the most basic level, scientists on the antibody and vaccine trials will look at infection rates to see if the interventions work. Whether they do or not, researchers will want to know why. It’s on the second floor of this building, in the Cape Town HVTN Immunology Laboratory, opened by Fred Hutchinson in 2013, that many of the answers will be found.

On this morning, the mostly South African staffers are practicing. In a blue gown, booties and two sets of gloves, Zinhle Mgaga uses a pipette to draw liquid from dishes containing tissue samples that have been mixed with antibodies and with HIV grown at Fred Hutch and shipped to Cape Town.

She puts the liquid in new dishes, which she wraps in foil, places in a Ziploc bag and transfers to a freezer set to minus 80 degrees Celsius.

Reporter Nina Shapiro traveled to South Africa on an International Reporting Project fellowship. Funding for overseas reporting by The Seattle Times is provided by a grant from the Seattle International Foundation.

Later, staffers will look at how well the antibodies have fought the virus.

Walking around the Cape Town lab, you could be forgiven for thinking you were at Fred Hutch in Seattle, and that’s by design. By using the same equipment and procedures, Fred Hutch can distribute the scientific work when the trials ramp up, said lab director Erica Andersen-Nissen, an American who last worked in Seattle under McElrath.

She said she also wants her staff of 14 to feel part of a bigger, well-resourced institution.

Yet, she said, “I don’t want people working here to feel like they’re working for an American company. These are vaccine trials being done in South Africa on South Africans. And the science is being done here, not just taken away to another country that has a lot of money and influence.”

She has made adjustments, including providing more vacation time than typical for an American company, making sure those who live in crime-ridden townships don’t go home in the dark and tasking HR in Seattle with drawing up a hiring plan in accordance with South African racial-equity guidelines.

Creating this bicontinental culture is a “delicate dance,” said Andersen-Nissen.

Nothing would work — not the lab, not the experiments, not the push for a vaccine — without people coming forward and submitting to pokes and prods. Despite wariness, thousands of South Africans have taken part in clinical trials over the years.

Jonathan Stadler, a medical anthropologist at Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand, has studied why. Money can be a motivation; participants typically get $10 or so for a clinical visit, to compensate for time and transportation. Stadler, however, sees something deeper.

“This is about them forging new identities,” he said. “It’s almost comparable to going through an educational experience.”

A visit to a clinic isn’t a dry, mechanical event. Staff educate participants about trials and HIV prevention in general. They offer free HIV testing, contraception and other care. They create welcoming spaces to socialize, a contrast to crowded public clinics.

“Suddenly you have a place you can go to where people actually care about you, take you seriously and spend an awful lot of time with you,” Stadler said.

You can see the appeal for Thulani Ralarala, 22, and Thandile Mazula, 19 — friends from the Gugulethu township outside Cape Town who are taking part in the vaccine-safety study.

When Mazula heard the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre needed volunteers, he said he wasn’t doing anything but sitting at home. Unemployment in South Africa stands at roughly 25 percent.

At the clinic, friendly staff lay out sandwiches and drinks. “I feel like I’m home when I’m here,” he said.

And he realized: “These people are trying to help.” He has seen a number of people die from AIDS, including a friend’s mother.

At home, the two friends lack hot water, share a room with relatives (in Mazula’s case, a shack) and worry about how to get money to go back to school. Here, they feel they are doing something important.

“I wanted to be part of this,” Ralarala said.

Helping fight HIV, Gray said, is something young people can tell grandparents once considered “young lions” for toppling apartheid. She imagined what a participant might say: “I also want to be a young lion.”

Fox News CEO Roger Ailes is in talks with 21st Century Fox that will likely lead to his departure following allegations of sexual harassment.

Several of his longtime employees, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expected Ailes would depart within days -- a stunning and ignoble end to a twenty year career creating and leading the Fox News Channel.

On Tuesday night, even The New York Post -- which is owned by the same family that owns 21st Century Fox -- reported that "the end is near" for Ailes.

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch tapped Ailes to found and run Fox News, which launched in 1996, ushering in a controversial new era in cable news.

The channel claimed to be "fair and balanced," but in reality its programming was tilted in favor of conservative opinions and Republican politics, reflecting the views of Ailes himself. Fox mixed daily news reporting and nightly conservative opinion in ways that many critics found to be damaging to American discourse. But Fox's many fans said it was a necessary counterweight to liberal media bias.

Within six years, Fox came to dominate cable news ratings, dethroning CNN, and it has been a wildly successful business, with annual profits believed to exceed $1 billion.

The rumors about Ailes' departure heated up Tuesday afternoon. The Drudge Report initially suggested that the exit deal was already done and that Ailes would receive a $40 million pay package. Drudge, a widely-read conservative news site, also shared what appeared to be a unsigned separation agreement.

Within minutes, however, the site deleted the image and took down the claim that Ailes was out.

"There is no deal," Ailes' attorney Susan Estrich told CNNMoney. "When there is an agreement, if there is an agreement, 21st Century Fox will make an announcement." Estrich also said the "term sheet" that Drudge published "does not reflect any deal" and that Ailes had not seen it.

Several other news outlets also reported that Ailes was officially leaving Fox before backpedaling around 5 p.m. Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Fox staffers frantically refreshed their Twitter feeds, checking for the latest information. Staffers were not formally told anything by the company.

But 21st Century Fox said in a statement that no exit agreement had been reached. "The review is ongoing," Fox said, referring to the internal review that the Murdochs ordered after ex-anchor Gretchen Carlson accused Ailes of sexual harassment in a lawsuit earlier this month.

Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James jointly run 21st Century Fox.

On Monday, New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman reported that the three Murdochs "have settled on removing" Ailes.

On Tuesday, Sherman followed up with a report that lawyers for 21st Century Fox had given Ailes "a deadline of August 1 to resign or face being fired for cause."

The most explosive part of Sherman's report involved Megyn Kelly, Fox's 9 p.m. host.

Citing anonymous sources, he said Kelly told investigators that Ailes sexually harassed her a decade ago and described it "in detail" to lawyers.

Through his representatives, Ailes vigorously denied accusations that he sexually harassed Fox News employees, including Kelly.

Kelly did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the report. But her lawyer, Willis Goldsmith, released a statement to the media saying that she was "fully and truthfully" cooperating with the investigation.

"At the request of 21st Century Fox, Paul, Weiss is conducting a review of the allegations against Roger Ailes," Goldsmith's statement read. "Megyn Kelly has made no public comment on the matter, nor will she while the review is pending, other than to say she has cooperated with the inquiry fully and truthfully."

And the New York-based law firm conducting the review -- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison -- has not commented on the review.

Estrich issued a statement saying that Ailes "never sexually harassed" her.

"In fact, he has spent much of the last decade promoting and helping her to achieve the stardom she earned, for which she has repeatedly and publicly thanked him," she said.

The fast-moving developments -- and the ensuing panic within the network -- are happening while Kelly and many of Fox's other journalists are in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention.

A high-ranking source said that Ailes participated in the network's daily 9 a.m. editorial call, and made no mention of the controversy, but did not participate in the daily 2:30 p.m. followup call.

"I don't see how Roger can survive this," the source said.

Several sources said the law firm's attorneys are undertaking a thorough review of the harassment allegations, interviewing past and present Fox staffers.

In recent days, several former Fox staffers told CNNMoney that they have their own stories to tell about Ailes, but are reluctant to do so publicly, citing restrictive non-disparagement clauses in their separation agreements.

Sherman reported on Tuesday that 21st Century Fox is "waiving" those clauses, thereby allowing the women to speak to the lawyers conducting the review.

Though a number of current and former Fox staffers have spoken out on Ailes' behalf over the past two weeks, most are now staying silent about the deepening controversy.

Variety's Cynthia Littleton was able to ask 7 p.m. host Greta Van Susteren about Ailes' status during Monday's convention coverage, and the host said she "doesn't know anything."

Another host, Geraldo Rivera, weighed in on Tuesday, tweeting an apparent response to Sherman's reports.

"Don't believe the crap about" Ailes, Rivera wrote. "Only ones talking dirt are those who hate #FoxNews & want to hurt network that's kicking their ass."

A Republican power broker and TV legend, Ailes is not to be underestimated.

Ailes, who was a media consultant to three Republican presidents before launching Fox News, is as much a political operator as he is a media executive. Through Fox, he continued to wield significant influence over and in the Republican party, even consulting with presidential candidates like Donald Trump, according to a source with knowledge of the situation, and trying to enlist certain people to run for office, including Gen. David H. Petraeus.

But the Murdoch sons who are gradually taking control of 21st Century Fox do not have the same affinity for Ailes that their father Rupert does.

If Ailes is indeed on the way out, it's "arguably a bigger story for conservatives than anything happening in Cleveland this week -- or maybe USA in Nov," CNN media analyst Bill Carter tweeted Monday.

One of his followers replied and compared it to "Apple without Steve Jobs."

Lately Google is spending a lot of time — and money — trying to convince journalists it wants to be friends.

In recent months, they’ve introduced Accelerated Mobile Pages , the recently launched Google News Lab , and team-ups with companies like The New York Times on virtual reality projects using Google Cardboard . (Not to mention the Google Journalism Fellows , one of whom is hosted here at Nieman Lab each summer.)

Now Google is officially launching a €150 million ($166 million) fund to invest in online journalism experiments from publishers across Europe. The fund is part of Google’s broader Digital News Initiative , launched in the spring as part of the company’s campaign to make friends out of enemies in Europe

The fund will invest in projects for the next three years, covering three rounds of applications starting this fall. The deadline for companies looking to apply for the first round is December 4. The project is only open to European publishers, and according to Google, 120 companies have already signed up. Notably, Google does not plan to take any ownership stake in the projects it funds.

Google is funding media experiments at different levels as part of the program. According to the company’s blog post:

Prototype projects: open to organisations — and to individuals — that meet the eligibility criteria, and require up to €50k of funding. These projects should be very early stage, with ideas yet to be designed and assumptions yet to be tested. We will fast-track such projects and will fund 100% of the total cost. Medium projects: open to organisations that meet the eligibility criteria and require up to €300k of funding. We will accept funding requests up to 70% of the total cost of the project. Large projects: open to organisations that meet the eligibility criteria and require more than €300k of funding. We will accept funding requests up to 70% of the total cost of the project. Funding is capped at €1 million.

Google’s newfound diplomacy and philanthropy comes after years of battling with European publishers about the company’s influence over advertising, search, and visibility in Google News. In 2013, the company created a precursor to the Digital News Initiative with a €60 million fund to help spur innovation in French media companies

The former head of that program, Ludovic Blecher, a former editor-in-chief of Liberation.fr and a Nieman Fellow in our class of 2013, now oversees the innovation fund at the Digital News Initiative.

“What is really important for the projects we’re looking for is we want specific projects and not the broad digital agenda or roadmap of publishers,” he told me.

The fund is designed to help publishers, ranging from newspapers or other legacy media to startups, build out projects they can’t complete on their own. That’s a fairly broad area media companies could fill with ideas, which is why Blecher says they want ideas that have a specific business plan, performance indicators, or other goals and benchmarks that can be measured. “It’s about the creation of new revenue streams and addressing the creation of original journalism,” he said.

A group comprised of Google employees and news executives from around Europe, include companies like Spiegel Online and Telegraph Media Group, is overseeing the application process for the fund. A small team will process applications and make selections of prototype and medium-sized projects. The larger body will make the final decision on who receives funding.

Ideally, the Digital News Initiative would jumpstart dozens of skunkworks projects in media companies around the European Union. Blecher said they want to encourage publishers to take risks on the type of storytelling or revenue-generating projects that have been developed by their counterparts in the U.S.

One lesson from his time leading Google’s media innovation fund in France was the need for specificity in the projects from media companies. The best way to effect change at an individual company, and create a chance for another company to duplicate that, is to focus on a project, not a broader goal or hiring for specific positions, he said.

But the other lesson, Blecher said, was that publishers would rather have Google working alongside them rather than at cross purposes. Given that the relationship previously included threats, lawsuits, and acrimony, collaboration could be a marked improvement.

“It’s not just a fund,” Blecher said. “It’s about having discussions with publishers.”

If electric vehicles don’t take off, maybe we can achieve fuel economy targets with cars that combine a little bit of everything.

Efficient engine: This modified Volkswagen diesel engine runs mostly on natural gas.

Researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich have developed an ultra-efficient new engine that runs on a combination of natural gas and diesel. When combined with a battery and electric motor to make a hybrid vehicle, it could allow a car to get the equivalent of 80 miles per gallon, the researchers say. That’s far better than the 50 miles per gallon you can expect from the most efficient existing hybrids such as the Toyota Prius. The only catch would be finding both natural gas and diesel for refueling.

In theory, the technology could provide an alternative to electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids for achieving strict fuel economy standards around the world. In Europe, the standards require cars to achieve the equivalent of 55 miles per gallon, on average, by 2020. In the U.S., vehicle fleets need to hit that target by 2025. Doing so will inevitably require automakers to sell some vehicles that surpass those targets to offset emissions from SUVs and other larger vehicles.

Christopher Onder, a senior scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute, says the new design could provide “a bridge to when electric vehicles are really affordable.” The researchers estimate the technology would add about $8,000 to the cost of a conventional gasoline-powered car. Some electric vehicle technology costs far more. The electric version of the Ford Focus, for example, costs $19,000 more than the gas-powered one.

The Zurich researchers modified a diesel engine, which is already very efficient, to run on natural gas, which reduces emissions compared to burning diesel. To allow a diesel engine to run efficiently on natural gas, the researchers injected a little diesel fuel at certain points to get the natural gas to ignite properly. The diesel accounts for 10 percent or less of the total fuel burned in the engine. The battery and electric motor kick in when the engine would run less efficiently, reducing emissions still more.

Natural-gas-powered cars already exist, but they have a shorter range than gasoline-powered cars by about 100 miles. But this isn’t the case with the new design, since the engine is so efficient, which would allow a vehicle to travel farther per liter of natural gas.

The researchers aren’t the first to try combining two fuel tanks in one vehicle. Others have developed engines that run on both gasoline and diesel (see “Reinventing the Gasoline Engine”). And injecting gasoline and ethanol into an engine separately (rather than blending them in fuel, as is done now) has been shown to improve fuel economy (see “The Incredible Shrinking Engine”). There have even been previous natural gas and diesel combinations for large engines, though not for cars. While these concepts have been around for years, they’ve yet to catch on. “The major hurdle is to get consumers used to the idea of using two fuels,” says Rolf Rietz, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

The new technology would be more expensive than an ordinary hybrid because diesel engines can cost thousands of dollars more than gasoline ones, and batteries and motors also add thousands of dollars. “This is a costly approach, and attractive results may be obtained with less cost and complexity,” says Larry Rinek, a senior technology consultant at Frost and Sullivan, a consulting company.

The technology could compete with plug-in vehicles, which can achieve similar emissions on short commutes by traveling on electricity stored from the grid before using gasoline. But plug-in hybrids could, in fact, be more expensive than the new technology. The Ford C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid, for example, costs $16,000 more than a similar gasoline-powered car.

Also, the efficiency of plug-in vehicles drops after the stored grid electricity is used up. In contrast, the new vehicle design would retain its fuel economy for long trips.
WikiLeaks has published 294,546 emails along with thousands of attached files from 762 mail boxes that allegedly belong to the primary email domain of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).

The most recent email in the trove released by the whistle-blowing organisation on Tuesday was sent on July 6, 2016. The oldest dates back to 2010.

"It should be noted that emails associated with the domain are mostly used for dealing with the world, as opposed to the most sensitive internal matters," WikiLeaks said on its official website.

WikiLeaks said it obtained the emails a week before Friday's attempted coup.

"WikiLeaks has moved forward its publication schedule in response to the government's post-coup purges.

We have verified the material and the source, who is not connected, in any way, to the elements behind the attempted coup, or to a rival political party or state," the organisation said.

WikiLeaks previously claimed that the Turkish government would attempt to censor the distribution of the documents, and urged the Turkish public to be ready to bypass any government attempts at blocking access to the material.

"Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup," the organisation said on Monday via Twitter.

"We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent. And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come."

WikiLeaks later claimed that its infrastructre was "under sustained attack," following its announcement of the imminent publication of the AKP emails.

"We are unsure of the true origin of the attack. The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies. We will prevail & publish," WikiLeaks said on Twitter.

Twitter today announced a new process for those seeking verified accounts.

“We want to make it even easier for people to find creators and influencers on Twitter so it makes sense for us to let people apply for verification,” said Tina Bhatnagar, Twitter’s vice president of User Services. “We hope opening up this application process results in more people finding great, high-quality accounts to follow, and for these creators and influencers to connect with a broader audience.”

As a refresher, the verification badge is a little blue symbol with a white checkmark. It’s designed to verify the authenticity of an account who otherwise might be subject to parody and fake accounts attempting to trick users into believing theirs is the real one. All of us here at TNW, and other popular publications have the verification badge.

Another conference. “Great.” This one’s different, trust us. Our new event for New York is focused on quality, not quantity. Find out more

Typically the feature is reserved for celebrities, journalists, politicians, and the like, but the new system could extend the verification badge, and additional features to anyone that could be at high risk of impersonation. Aside from the badge, it doesn’t fundamentally alter the Twitter experience or provide any features aside from a verified-only notification system that lets you filter replies to show only verified accounts.

Previously, Twitter had allowed users to apply for verification, but pulled the feature years back, presumably due to the number of new and otherwise non-worthy (spam, parody, etc.) accounts seeking verification. Since then, Twitter has manually verified all accounts, a process done behind the scenes, and without the ability for users to request it.

Currently, only 0.06 percent of the company’s 310 million monthly users are verified, according to a Twitter representative.

The application process will start rolling out today, and should be available globally later in the week. To apply, or learn more, check out the Twitter Help Center.

The Obama 2012 campaign used data analytics and the experimental method to assemble a winning coalition vote by vote. In doing so, it overturned the long dominance of TV advertising in U.S. politics and created something new in the world: a national campaign run like a local ward election, where the interests of individual voters were known and addressed.

Two years after Barack Obama’s election as president, Democrats suffered their worst defeat in decades. The congressional majorities that had given Obama his legislative successes, reforming the health-insurance and financial markets, were swept away in the midterm elections; control of the House flipped and the Democrats’ lead in the Senate shrank to an ungovernably slim margin. Pundits struggled to explain the rise of the Tea Party. Voters’ disappointment with the Obama agenda was evident as independents broke right and Democrats stayed home. In 2010, the Democratic National Committee failed its first test of the Obama era: it had not kept the Obama coalition together.

But for Democrats, there was bleak consolation in all this: Dan Wagner had seen it coming. When Wagner was hired as the DNC’s targeting director, in January of 2009, he became responsible for collecting voter information and analyzing it to help the committee approach individual voters by direct mail and phone. But he appreciated that the raw material he was feeding into his statistical models amounted to a series of surveys on voters’ attitudes and preferences. He asked the DNC’s technology department to develop software that could turn that information into tables, and he called the result Survey Manager.

That fall, when a special election was held to fill an open congressional seat in upstate New York, Wagner successfully predicted the final margin within 150 votes—well before Election Day. Months later, pollsters projected that Martha Coakley was certain to win another special election, to fill the Massachusetts Senate seat left empty by the death of Ted Kennedy. But Wagner’s Survey Manager correctly predicted that the Republican Scott Brown was likely to prevail in the strongly Democratic state. “It’s one thing to be right when you’re going to win,” says Jeremy Bird, who served as national deputy director of Organizing for America, the Obama campaign in abeyance, housed at the DNC. “It’s another thing to be right when you’re going to lose.”

It is yet another thing to be right five months before you’re going to lose. As the 2010 midterms approached, Wagner built statistical models for selected Senate races and 74 congressional districts. Starting in June, he began predicting the elections’ outcomes, forecasting the margins of victory with what turned out to be improbable accuracy. But he hadn’t gotten there with traditional polls. He had counted votes one by one. His first clue that the party was in trouble came from thousands of individual survey calls matched to rich statistical profiles in the DNC’s databases. Core Democratic voters were telling the DNC’s callers that they were much less likely to vote than statistical probability suggested. Wagner could also calculate how much the Democrats’ mobilization programs would do to increase turnout among supporters, and in most races he knew it wouldn’t be enough to cover the gap revealing itself in Survey Manager’s tables.

His congressional predictions were off by an average of only 2.5 percent. “That was a proof point for a lot of people who don’t understand the math behind it but understand the value of what that math produces,” says Mitch Stewart, Organizing for America’s director. “Once that first special [election] happened, his word was the gold standard at the DNC.”

The significance of Wagner’s achievement went far beyond his ability to declare winners months before Election Day. His approach amounted to a decisive break with 20th-century tools for tracking public opinion, which revolved around quarantining small samples that could be treated as representative of the whole. Wagner had emerged from a cadre of analysts who thought of voters as individuals and worked to aggregate projections about their opinions and behavior until they revealed a composite picture of everyone. His techniques marked the fulfillment of a new way of thinking, a decade in the making, in which voters were no longer trapped in old political geographies or tethered to traditional demographic categories, such as age or gender, depending on which attributes pollsters asked about or how consumer marketers classified them for commercial purposes. Instead, the electorate could be seen as a collection of individual citizens who could each be measured and assessed on their own terms. Now it was up to a candidate who wanted to lead those people to build a campaign that would interact with them the same way.

Dan Wagner, the chief analytics officer for Obama 2012, led the campaign’s “Cave” of data scientists.

After the voters returned Obama to office for a second term, his campaign became celebrated for its use of technology—much of it developed by an unusual team of coders and engineers—that redefined how individuals could use the Web, social media, and smartphones to participate in the political process. A mobile app allowed a canvasser to download and return walk sheets without ever entering a campaign office; a Web platform called Dashboard gamified volunteer activity by ranking the most active supporters; and “targeted sharing” protocols mined an Obama backer’s Facebook network in search of friends the campaign wanted to register, mobilize, or persuade.

But underneath all that were scores describing particular voters: a new political currency that predicted the behavior of individual humans. The campaign didn’t just know who you were; it knew exactly how it could turn you into the type of person it wanted you to be.

The Scores

Four years earlier, Dan Wagner had been working at a Chicago economic consultancy, using forecasting skills developed studying econometrics at the University of Chicago, when he fell for Barack Obama and decided he wanted to work on his home-state senator’s 2008 presidential campaign. Wagner, then 24, was soon in Des Moines, handling data entry for the state voter file that guided Obama to his crucial victory in the Iowa caucuses. He bounced from state to state through the long primary calendar, growing familiar with voter data and the ways of using statistical models to intelligently sort the electorate. For the general election, he was named lead targeter for the Great Lakes/Ohio River Valley region, the most intense battleground in the country.

After Obama’s victory, many of his top advisors decamped to Washington to make preparations for governing. Wagner was told to stay behind and serve on a post-election task force that would review a campaign that had looked, to the outside world, technically flawless.

In the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s targeters had assigned every voter in the country a pair of scores based on the probability that the individual would perform two distinct actions that mattered to the campaign: casting a ballot and supporting Obama. These scores were derived from an unprecedented volume of ongoing survey work. For each battleground state every week, the campaign’s call centers conducted 5,000 to 10,000 so-called short-form interviews that quickly gauged a voter’s preferences, and 1,000 interviews in a long-form version that was more like a traditional poll. To derive individual-level predictions, algorithms trawled for patterns between these opinions and the data points the campaign had assembled for every voter—as many as one thousand variables each, drawn from voter registration records, consumer data warehouses, and past campaign contacts.

This innovation was most valued in the field. There, an almost perfect cycle of microtargeting models directed volunteers to scripted conversations with specific voters at the door or over the phone. Each of those interactions produced data that streamed back into Obama’s servers to refine the models pointing volunteers toward the next door worth a knock. The efficiency and scale of that process put the Democrats well ahead when it came to profiling voters. John McCain’s campaign had, in most states, run its statistical model just once, assigning each voter to one of its microtargeting segments in the summer. McCain’s advisors were unable to recalculate the probability that those voters would support their candidate as the dynamics of the race changed. Obama’s scores, on the other hand, adjusted weekly, responding to new events like Sarah Palin’s vice-presidential nomination or the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

Within the campaign, however, the Obama data operations were understood to have shortcomings. As was typical in political information infrastructure, knowledge about people was stored separately from data about the campaign’s interactions with them, mostly because the databases built for those purposes had been developed by different consultants who had no interest in making their systems work together.

But the task force knew the next campaign wasn’t stuck with that situation. Obama would run his final race not as an insurgent against a party establishment, but as the establishment itself. For four years, the task force members knew, their team would control the Democratic Party’s apparatus. Their demands, not the offerings of consultants and vendors, would shape the marketplace. Their report recommended developing a “constituent relationship management system” that would allow staff across the campaign to look up individuals not just as voters or volunteers or donors or website users but as citizens in full. “We realized there was a problem with how our data and infrastructure interacted with the rest of the campaign, and we ought to be able to offer it to all parts of the campaign,” says Chris Wegrzyn, a database applications developer who served on the task force.

Wegrzyn became the DNC’s lead targeting developer and oversaw a series of costly acquisitions, all intended to free the party from the traditional dependence on outside vendors. The committee installed a Siemens Enterprise System phone-dialing unit that could put out 1.2 million calls a day to survey voters’ opinions. Later, party leaders signed off on a $280,000 license to use Vertica software from Hewlett-Packard that allowed their servers to access not only the party’s 180-million-person voter file but all the data about volunteers, donors, and those who had interacted with Obama online.

Many of those who went to Washington after the 2008 election in order to further the president’s political agenda returned to Chicago in the spring of 2011 to work on his reëlection. The chastening losses they had experienced in Washington separated them from those who had known only the ecstasies of 2008. “People who did ‘08, but didn’t do ‘10, and came back in ‘11 or ‘12—they had the hardest culture clash,” says Jeremy Bird, who became national field director on the reëlection campaign. But those who went to Washington and returned to Chicago developed a particular appreciation for Wagner’s methods of working with the electorate at an atomic level. It was a way of thinking that perfectly aligned with their ­simple theory of what it would take to win the president reëlection: get everyone who had voted for him in 2008 to do it again. At the same time, they knew they would need to succeed at registering and mobilizing new voters, especially in some of the fastest-growing demographic categories, to make up for any 2008 voters who did defect.

Obama’s campaign began the election year confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House. They may have cast those votes by secret ballot, but Obama’s analysts could look at the Democrats’ vote totals in each precinct and identify the people most likely to have backed him. Pundits talked in the abstract about reassembling Obama’s 2008 coalition. But within the campaign, the goal was literal. They would reassemble the coalition, one by one, through personal contacts.

The Experiments

When Jim Messina arrived in Chicago as Obama’s newly minted campaign manager in January of 2011, he imposed a mandate on his recruits: they were to make decisions based on measurable data. But that didn’t mean quite what it had four years before. The 2008 campaign had been “data-driven,” as people liked to say. This reflected a principled imperative to challenge the political establishment with an empirical approach to electioneering, and it was greatly influenced by David Plouffe, the 2008 campaign manager, who loved metrics, spreadsheets, and performance reports. Plouffe wanted to know: How many of a field office’s volunteer shifts had been filled last weekend? How much money did that ad campaign bring in?

But for all its reliance on data, the 2008 Obama campaign had remained insulated from the most important methodological innovation in 21st-century politics. In 1998, Yale professors Don Green and Alan Gerber conducted the first randomized controlled trial in modern political science, assigning New Haven voters to receive nonpartisan election reminders by mail, phone, or in-person visit from a canvasser and measuring which group saw the greatest increase in turnout. The subsequent wave of field experiments by Green, Gerber, and their followers focused on mobilization, testing competing modes of contact and get-out-the-vote language to see which were most successful.

The first Obama campaign used the findings of such tests to tweak call scripts and canvassing protocols, but it never fully embraced the experimental revolution itself. After Dan Wagner moved to the DNC, the party decided it would start conducting its own experiments. He hoped the committee could become “a driver of research for the Democratic Party.”

To that end, he hired the Analyst Institute, a Washington-based consortium founded under the AFL-CIO’s leadership in 2006 to coördinate field research projects across the electioneering left and distribute the findings among allies. Much of the experimental world’s research had focused on voter registration, because that was easy to measure. The breakthrough was that registration no longer had to be approached passively; organizers did not have to simply wait for the unenrolled to emerge from anonymity, sign a form, and, they hoped, vote. New techniques made it possible to intelligently profile nonvoters: commercial data warehouses sold lists of all voting-age adults, and comparing those lists with registration rolls revealed eligible candidates, each attached to a home address to which an application could be mailed. Applying microtargeting models identified which nonregistrants were most likely to be Democrats and which ones Republicans.

The Obama campaign embedded social scientists from the Analyst Institute among its staff. Party officials knew that adding new Democratic voters to the registration rolls was a crucial element in their strategy for 2012. But already the campaign had ambitions beyond merely modifying nonparticipating citizens’ behavior through registration and mobilization. It wanted to take on the most vexing problem in politics: changing voters’ minds.

The expansion of individual-level data had made possible the kind of testing that could help do that. Experimenters had typically calculated the average effect of their interventions across the entire population. But as campaigns developed deep portraits of the voters in their databases, it became possible to measure the attributes of the people who were actually moved by an experiment’s impact. A series of tests in 2006 by the women’s group Emily’s List had illustrated the potential of conducting controlled trials with microtargeting databases. When the group sent direct mail in favor of Democratic gubernatorial candidates, it barely budged those whose scores placed them in the middle of the partisan spectrum; it had a far greater impact upon those who had been profiled as soft (or nonideological) Republicans.

That test, and others that followed, demonstrated the limitations of traditional targeting. Such techniques rested on a series of long-standing assumptions—for instance, that middle-of-the-roaders were the most persuadable and that infrequent voters were the likeliest to be captured in a get-out-the-vote drive. But the experiments introduced new uncertainty. People who were identified as having a 50 percent likelihood of voting for a Democrat might in fact be torn between the two parties, or they might look like centrists only because no data attached to their records pushed a partisan prediction in one direction or another. “The scores in the middle are the people we know less about,” says Chris Wyant, a 2008 field organizer who became the campaign’s general election director in Ohio four years later. “The extent to which we were guessing about persuasion was not lost on any of us.”

One way the campaign sought to identify the ripest targets was through a series of what the Analyst Institute called “experiment-informed programs,” or EIPs, designed to measure how effective different types of messages were at moving public opinion.

The traditional way of doing this had been to audition themes and language in focus groups and then test the winning material in polls to see which categories of voters responded positively to each approach. Any insights were distorted by the artificial settings and by the tiny samples of demographic subgroups in traditional polls. “You’re making significant resource decisions based on 160 people?” asks Mitch Stewart, director of the Democratic campaign group Organizing for America. “Isn’t that nuts? And people have been doing that for decades!”

An experimental program would use those steps to develop a range of prospective messages that could be subjected to empirical testing in the real world. Experimenters would randomly assign voters to receive varied sequences of direct mail—four pieces on the same policy theme, each making a slightly different case for Obama—and then use ongoing survey calls to isolate the attributes of those whose opinions changed as a result.

In March, the campaign used this technique to test various ways of promoting the administration’s health-care policies. One series of mailers described Obama’s regulatory reforms; another advised voters that they were now entitled to free regular check-ups and ought to schedule one. The experiment revealed how much voter response differed by age, especially among women. Older women thought more highly of the policies when they received reminders about preventive care; younger women liked them more when they were told about contraceptive coverage and new rules that prohibited insurance companies from charging women more.

When Paul Ryan was named to the Republican ticket in August, Obama’s advisors rushed out an EIP that compared different lines of attack about Medicare. The results were surprising. “The electorate [had seemed] very inelastic,” says Terry Walsh, who coördinated the campaign’s polling and paid-media spending. “In fact, when we did the Medicare EIPs, we got positive movement that was very heartening, because it was at a time when we were not seeing a lot of movement in the electorate.” But that movement came from quarters where a traditional campaign would never have gone hunting for minds it could change. The Obama team found that voters between 45 and 65 were more likely to change their views about the candidates after hearing Obama’s Medicare arguments than those over 65, who were currently eligible for the program.

A similar strategy of targeting an unexpected population emerged from a July EIP testing Obama’s messages aimed at women. The voters most responsive to the campaign’s arguments about equal-pay measures and women’s health, it found, were those whose likelihood of supporting the president was scored at merely 20 and 40 percent. Those scores suggested that they probably shared Republican attitudes; but here was one thing that could pull them to Obama. As a result, when Obama unveiled a direct-mail track addressing only women’s issues, it wasn’t to shore up interest among core parts of the Democratic coalition, but to reach over for conservatives who were at odds with their party on gender concerns. “The whole goal of the women’s track was to pick off votes for Romney,” says Walsh. “We were able to persuade people who fell low on candidate support scores if we gave them a specific message.”

At the same time, Obama’s campaign was pursuing a second, even more audacious adventure in persuasion: one-on-one interaction. Traditionally, campaigns have restricted their persuasion efforts to channels like mass media or direct mail, where they can control presentation, language, and targeting. Sending volunteers to persuade voters would mean forcing them to interact with opponents, or with voters who were undecided because they were alienated from politics on delicate issues like abortion. Campaigns have typically resisted relinquishing control of ground-level interactions with voters to risk such potentially combustible situations; they felt they didn’t know enough about their supporters or volunteers. “You can have a negative impact,” says Jeremy Bird, who served as national deputy director of Organizing for America. “You can hurt your candidate.”

In February, however, Obama volunteers attempted 500,000 conversations with the goal of winning new supporters. Voters who’d been randomly selected from a group identified as persuadable were polled after a phone conversation that began with a volunteer reading from a script. “We definitely find certain people moved more than other people,” says Bird. Analysts identified their attributes and made them the core of a persuasion model that predicted, on a scale of 0 to 10, the likelihood that a voter could be pulled in Obama’s direction after a single volunteer interaction. The experiment also taught Obama’s field department about its volunteers. Those in California, which had always had an exceptionally mature volunteer organization for a non-­battleground state, turned out to be especially persuasive: voters called by Californians, no matter what state they were in themselves, were more likely to become Obama supporters.

Alex Lundry created Mitt Romney’s data science unit. It was less than one-tenth the size of Obama’s analytics team.

With these findings in hand, Obama’s strategists grew confident that they were no longer restricted to advertising as a channel for persuasion. They began sending trained volunteers to knock on doors or make phone calls with the objective of changing minds.

That dramatic shift in the culture of electioneering was felt on the streets, but it was possible only because of advances in analytics. Chris Wegrzyn, a database applications developer, developed a program code-named Airwolf that matched county and state lists of people who had requested mail ballots with the campaign’s list of e-mail addresses. Likely Obama supporters would get regular reminders from their local field organizers, asking them to return their ballots, and, once they had, a message thanking them and proposing other ways to be involved in the campaign. The local organizer would receive daily lists of the voters on his or her turf who had outstanding ballots so that the campaign could follow up with personal contact by phone or at the doorstep. “It is a fundamental way of tying together the online and offline worlds,” says Wagner.

Wagner, however, was turning his attention beyond the field. By June of 2011, he was chief analytics officer for the campaign and had begun making the rounds of the other units at headquarters, from fund-raising to communications, offering to help “solve their problems with data.” He imagined the analytics department—now a 54-person staff, housed in a windowless office known as the Cave—as an “in-house consultancy” with other parts of the campaign as its clients. “There’s a process of helping people learn about the tools so they can be a participant in the process,” he says. “We essentially built products for each of those various departments that were paired up with a massive database we had.”

The Flow

As job notices seeking specialists in text analytics, computational advertising, and online experiments came out of the incumbent’s campaign, Mitt Romney’s advisors at the Republicans’ headquarters in Boston’s North End watched with a combination of awe and perplexity. Throughout the primaries, Romney had appeared to be the only Republican running a 21st-century campaign, methodically banking early votes in states like Florida and Ohio before his disorganized opponents could establish operations there.

But the Republican winner’s relative sophistication in the primaries belied a poverty of expertise compared with the Obama campaign. Since his first campaign for governor of Massachusetts, in 2002, Romney had relied upon ­TargetPoint Consulting, a Virginia firm that was then a pioneer in linking information from consumer data warehouses to voter registration records and using it to develop individual-level predictive models. It was TargetPoint’s CEO, Alexander Gage, who had coined the term “microtargeting” to describe the process, which he modeled on the corporate world’s approach to customer relationship management.

Such techniques had offered George W. Bush’s reëlection campaign a significant edge in targeting, but Republicans had done little to institutionalize that advantage in the years since. By 2006, Democrats had not only matched Republicans in adopting commercial marketing techniques; they had moved ahead by integrating methods developed in the social sciences.

Romney’s advisors knew that Obama was building innovative internal data analytics departments, but they didn’t feel a need to match those activities. “I don’t think we thought, relative to the marketplace, we could be the best at data in-house all the time,” Romney’s digital director, Zac Moffatt, said in July. “Our idea is to find the best firms to work with us.” As a result, Romney remained dependent on TargetPoint to develop voter segments, often just once, and then deliver them to the campaign’s databases. That was the structure Obama had abandoned after winning the nomination in 2008.

In May a TargetPoint vice president, Alex Lundry, took leave from his post at the firm to assemble a data science unit within Romney’s headquarters. To round out his team, Lundry brought in Tom Wood, a University of Chicago postdoctoral student in political science, and Brent McGoldrick, a veteran of Bush’s 2004 campaign who had left politics for the consulting firm Financial Dynamics (later FTI Consulting), where he helped financial-services, health-care, and energy companies communicate better. But Romney’s data science team was less than one-tenth the size of Obama’s analytics department. Without a large in-house staff to handle the massive national data sets that made it possible to test and track citizens, Romney’s data scientists never tried to deepen their understanding of individual behavior. Instead, they fixated on trying to unlock one big, persistent mystery, which Lundry framed this way: “How can we get a sense of whether this advertising is working?”

“You usually get GRPs and tracking polls,” he says, referring to the gross ratings points that are the basic unit of measuring television buys. “There’s a very large causal leap you have to make from one to the other.”

Lundry decided to focus on more manageable ways of measuring what he called the information flow. His team converted topics of political communication into discrete units they called “entities.” They initially classified 200 of them, including issues like the auto industry bailout, controversies like the one surrounding federal funding for the solar-power company Solyndra, and catchphrases like “the war on women.” When a new concept (such as Obama’s offhand remark, during a speech about our common dependence on infrastructure, that “you didn’t build that”) emerged as part of the election-year lexicon, the analysts added it to the list. They tracked each entity on the National Dialogue Monitor, TargetPoint’s system for measuring the frequency and tone with which certain topics are mentioned across all media. TargetPoint also integrated content collected from newspaper websites and closed-caption transcripts of broadcast programs. Lundry’s team aimed to examine how every entity fared over time in each of two categories: the informal sphere of social media, especially Twitter, and the journalistic product that campaigns call earned press coverage.

Ultimately, Lundry wanted to assess the impact that each type of public attention had on what mattered most to them: Romney’s position in the horse race. He turned to vector autoregression models, which equities traders use to isolate the influence of single variables on market movements. In this case, Lundry’s team looked for patterns in the relationship between the National Dialogue Monitor’s data and Romney’s numbers in Gallup’s daily tracking polls. By the end of July, they thought they had identified a three-step process they called “Wood’s Triangle.”

Within three or four days of a new entity’s entry into the conversation, either through paid ads or through the news cycle, it was possible to make a well-informed hypothesis about whether the topic was likely to win media attention by tracking whether it generated Twitter chatter. That informal conversation among political-class elites typically led to traditional print or broadcast press coverage one to two days later, and that, in turn, might have an impact on the horse race. “We saw this process over and over again,” says Lundry.

They began to think of ads as a “shock to the system”—a way to either introduce a new topic or restore focus on an area in which elite interest had faded. If an entity didn’t gain its own energy—as when the Republicans charged over the summer that the White House had waived the work requirements in the federal welfare rules—Lundry would propose a “re-shock to the system” with another ad on the subject five to seven days later. After 12 to 14 days, Lundry found, an entity had passed through the system and exhausted its ability to alter public opinion—so he would recommend to the campaign’s communications staff that they move on to something new.

Those insights offered campaign officials a theory of information flows, but they provided no guidance in how to allocate campaign resources in order to win the Electoral College. Assuming that Obama had superior ground-level data and analytics, Romney’s campaign tried to leverage its rivals’ strategy to shape its own; if Democrats thought a state or media market was competitive, maybe that was evidence that Republicans should think so too. “We were necessarily reactive, because we were putting together the plane as it took off,” Lundry says. “They had an enormous head start on us.”

Romney’s political department began holding regular meetings to look at where in the country the Obama campaign was focusing resources like ad dollars and the president’s time. The goal was to try to divine the calculations behind those decisions. It was, in essence, the way Microsoft’s Bing approached Google: trying to reverse-engineer the market leader’s code by studying the visible output. “We watch where the president goes,” Dan ­Centinello, the Romney deputy political director who oversaw the meetings, said over the summer.

Obama’s media-buying strategy proved particularly hard to decipher. In early September, as part of his standard review, Lundry noticed that the week after the Democratic convention, Obama had aired 68 ads in Dothan, Alabama, a town near the Florida border. Dothan was one of the country’s smallest media markets, and Alabama one of the safest Republican states. Even though the area was known to savvy ad buyers as one of the places where a media market crosses state lines, Dothan TV stations reached only about 9,000 Florida voters, and around 7,000 of them had voted for John McCain in 2008. “This is a hard-core Republican media market,” Lundry says. “It’s incredibly tiny. But they were advertising there.”

Romney’s advisors might have formed a theory about the broader media environment, but whatever was sending Obama hunting for a small pocket of votes was beyond their measurement. “We could tell,” says McGoldrick, “that there was something in the algorithms that was telling them what to run.”

The March

In the summer of 2011, Carol Davidsen received a message from Dan Wagner. Already the Obama campaign was known for its relentless e-mails beseeching supporters to give their money or time, but this one offered something that intrigued Davidsen: a job. Wagner had sorted the campaign’s list of donors, stretching back to 2008, to find those who described their occupation with terms like “data” and “analytics” and sent them all invitations to apply for work in his new analytics department.

Davidsen was working at Navic Networks, a Microsoft-owned company that wrote code for set-top cable boxes to create a record of a user’s DVR or tuner history, when she heeded Wagner’s call. One year before Election Day, she started work in the campaign’s technology department to serve as product manager for Narwhal. That was the code name, borrowed from a tusked whale, for an ambitious effort to match records from previously unconnected databases so that a user’s online interactions with the campaign could be synchronized. With Narwhal, e-mail blasts asking people to volunteer could take their past donation history into consideration, and the algorithms determining how much a supporter would be asked to contribute could be shaped by knowledge about his or her reaction to previous solicitations. This integration enriched a technique, common in website development, that Obama’s online fund-raising efforts had used to good effect in 2008: the A/B test, in which users are randomly directed to different versions of a thing and their responses are compared. Now analysts could leverage personal data to identify the attributes of those who responded, and use that knowledge to refine subsequent appeals. “You can cite people’s other types of engagement,” says ­Amelia ­Showalter, Obama’s director of digital analytics. “We discovered that there were a lot of things that built goodwill, like signing the president’s birthday card or getting a free bumper sticker, that led them to become more engaged with the campaign in other ways.”

If online communication had been the aspect of the 2008 campaign subjected to the most rigorous empirical examination—it’s easy to randomly assign e-mails in an A/B test and compare click-through rates or donation levels—mass-media strategy was among those that received the least. Television and radio ads had to be purchased by geographic zone, and the available data on who watches which channels or shows, collected by research firms like Nielsen and Scarborough, often included little more than viewer age and gender. That might be good enough to guide buys for Schick or Foot Locker, but it’s of limited value for advertisers looking to define audiences in political terms.

As campaign manager Jim Messina prepared to spend as much as half a billion dollars on mass media for Obama’s reëlection, he set out to reinvent the process for allocating resources across broadcast, cable, satellite, and online channels. “If you think about the universe of possible places for an advertiser, it’s almost infinite,” says Amy Gershkoff, who was hired as the campaign’s media-planning director on the strength of her successful negotiations, while at her firm Changing Targets in 2009, to link the information from cable systems to individual microtargeting profiles. “There are tens of millions of opportunities where a campaign can put its next dollar. You have all this great, robust voter data that doesn’t fit together with the media data. How you knit that together is a challenge.”

By the start of 2012, ­Wagner had deftly wrested command of media planning into his own department. As he expanded the scope of analytics, he defined his purview as “the study and practice of resource optimization for the purpose of improving programs and earning votes more efficiently.” That usually meant calculating, for any campaign activity, the number of votes gained through a given amount of contact at a given cost.

But when it came to buying media, such calculations had been simply impossible, because campaigns were unable to link what they knew about voters to what cable providers knew about their customers. Obama’s advisors decided that the data made available in the private sector had long led political advertisers to ask the wrong questions. Walsh says of the effort to reimagine the media-targeting process: “It was not to get a better understanding of what 35-plus women watch on TV. It was to find out how many of our persuadable voters were watching those dayparts.”

Davidsen, whose previous work had left her intimately familiar with the rich data sets held in set-top boxes, understood that a lot of that data was available in the form of tuner and DVR histories collected by cable providers and then aggregated by research firms. For privacy reasons, however, the information was not available at the individual level. “The hardest thing in media buying right now is the lack of information,” she says.

Davidsen began negotiating to have research firms repackage their data in a form that would permit the campaign to access the individual histories without violating the cable providers’ privacy standards. Under a $350,000 deal she worked out with one company, Rentrak, the campaign provided a list of persuadable voters and their addresses, derived from its microtargeting models, and the company looked for them in the cable providers’ billing files. When a record matched, ­Rentrak would issue it a unique household ID that identified viewing data from a single set-top box but masked any personally identifiable information.

The Obama campaign had created its own television ratings system, a kind of Nielsen in which the only viewers who mattered were those not yet fully committed to a presidential candidate. But Davidsen had to get the information into a practical form by early May, when Obama strategists planned to start running their anti-Romney ads. She oversaw the development of a software platform the Obama staff called the Optimizer, which broke the day into 96 quarter-hour segments and assessed which time slots across 60 channels offered the greatest number of persuadable targets per dollar. (By September, she had unlocked an even richer trove of data: a cable system in Toledo, Ohio, that tracked viewers’ tuner histories by the second.) “The revolution of media buying in this campaign,” says Walsh, “was to turn what was a broadcast medium into something that looks a lot more like a narrowcast medium.”

When the Obama campaign did use television as a mass medium, it was because the Optimizer had concluded it would be a more efficient way of reaching persuadable targets. Sometimes a national cable ad was a better bargain than a large number of local buys in the 66 media markets reaching battleground states. But the occasional national buy also had other benefits. It could boost fund-raising and motivate volunteers in states that weren’t essential to Obama’s Electoral College arithmetic. And, says Davidsen, “it helps hide some of the strategy of your buying.”

Even without that tactic, Obama’s buys perplexed the Romney analysts in Boston. They had invested in their own media-intelligence platform, called Centraforce. It used some of the same aggregated data sources that were feeding into the Optimizer, and at times both seemed to send the campaigns to the same unlikely ad blocks—for example, in reruns on TV Land. But there was a lot more to what Lundry called Obama’s “highly variable” media strategy. Many of the Democrats’ ads were placed in fringe markets, on marginal stations, and at odd times where few political candidates had ever seen value. Romney’s data scientists simply could not decode those decisions without the voter models or persuasion experiments that helped Obama pick out individual targets. “We were never able to figure out the level of advertising and what they were trying to do,” says McGoldrick. “It wasn’t worth reverse-engineering, because what are you going to do?”

The Community

Although the voter opinion tables that emerged from the Cave looked a lot like polls, the analysts who produced them were disinclined to call them polls. The campaign had plenty of those, generated by a public-opinion team of eight outside firms, and new arrivals at the Chicago headquarters were shocked by the variegated breadth of the research that arrived on their desks daily. “We believed in combining the qual, which we did more than any campaign ever, with the quant, which we [also] did more than any other campaign, to make sure all communication for every level of the campaign was informed by what they found,” says David Simas, the director of opinion research.

Simas considered himself the “air-traffic controller” for such research, which was guided by a series of voter diaries that Obama’s team commissioned as it prepared for the reëlection campaign. “We needed to do something almost divorced from politics and get to the way they’re seeing their lives,” he says. The lead pollster, Joel Benenson, had respondents write about their experiences. The entries frequently used the word “disappointment,” which helped explain attitudes toward Obama’s administration but also spoke to a broader dissatisfaction with economic conditions. “That became the foundation for our entire research program,” says Simas.

Carol Davidsen matched Obama 2012’s lists of persuadable voters with cable providers’ billing information.

Obama’s advisors used those diaries to develop messages that contrasted Obama with Romney as a fighter for the middle class. Benenson’s national polls tested language to see which affected voters’ responses in survey experiments and direct questioning. A quartet of polling firms were assigned specific states and asked to figure out which national themes fit best with local concerns. Eventually, Obama’s media advisors created more than 500 ads and tested them before an online sample of viewers selected by focus-group director David Binder.

But the campaign had to play defense, too. When something potentially damaging popped up in the news, like Democratic consultant Hilary Rosen’s declaration that Ann Romney had “never worked a day in her life,” Simas checked in with the Community, a private online bulletin board populated by 100 undecided voters Binder had recruited. Simas would monitor Community conversations to see which news events penetrated voter consciousness. Sometimes he had Binder show its members controversial material—like a video clip of Obama’s “You didn’t build that” comment—and ask if it changed their views of the candidate. “For me, it was a very quick way to draw back and determine whether something was a problem or not a problem,” says Simas.

When Wagner started packaging his department’s research into something that campaign leadership could read like a poll, a pattern became apparent. Obama’s numbers in key battleground states were low in the analytic tables, but Romney’s were too. There were simply more undecided voters in such states—sometimes nearly twice as many as the traditional pollsters found. A basic methodological distinction explained this discrepancy: microtargeting models required interviewing a lot of unlikely voters to give shape to a profile of what a nonvoter looked like, while pollsters tracking the horse race wanted to screen more rigorously for those likely to cast a ballot. The rivalry between the two units trying to measure public opinion grew intense: the analytic polls were a threat to the pollsters’ primacy and, potentially, to their business model. “I spent a lot of time within the campaign explaining to people that the numbers we get from analytics and the numbers we get from external pollsters did not need strictly to be reconciled,” says Walsh. “They were different.”

The scope of the analytic research enabled it to pick up movements too small for traditional polls to perceive. As Simas reviewed Wagner’s analytic tables in mid-October, he was alarmed to see that what had been a Romney lead of one to two points in Green Bay, Wisconsin, had grown into an advantage of between six and nine. Green Bay was the only media market in the state to experience such a shift, and there was no obvious explanation. But it was hard to discount. Whereas a standard 800-person statewide poll might have reached 100 respondents in the Green Bay area, analytics was placing 5,000 calls in Wisconsin in each five-day cycle—and benefiting from tens of thousands of other field contacts—to produce microtargeting scores. Analytics was talking to as many people in the Green Bay media market as traditional pollsters were talking to across Wisconsin every week. “We could have the confidence level to say, ‘This isn’t noise,’” says Simas. So the campaign’s media buyers aired an ad attacking Romney on outsourcing and beseeched Messina to send former president Bill Clinton and Obama himself to rallies there. (In the end, Romney took the county 50.3 to 48.5 percent.)

For the most part, however, the analytic tables demonstrated how stable the electorate was, and how predictable individual voters could be. Polls from the media and academic institutions may have fluctuated by the hour, but drawing on hundreds of data points to judge whether someone was a likely voter proved more reliable than using a seven-question battery like Gallup’s to do the same. “When you see this Pogo stick happening with the public data—the electorate is just not that volatile,” says Mitch Stewart, director of the Democratic campaign group Organizing for America. The analytic data offered a source of calm.

Romney’s advisors were similarly sanguine, but they were losing. They, too, believed it possible to project the composition of the electorate, relying on a method similar to Gallup’s: pollster Neil Newhouse asked respondents how likely they were to cast a ballot. Those who answered that question with a seven or below on a 10-point scale were disregarded as not inclined to vote. But that ignored the experimental methods that made it possible to measure individual behavior and the impact that a campaign itself could have on a citizen’s motivation. As a result, the Republicans failed to account for voters that the Obama campaign could be mobilizing even if they looked to Election Day without enthusiasm or intensity.

On the last day of the race, Wagner and his analytics staff left the Cave and rode the elevator up one floor in the campaign’s Chicago skyscraper to join members of other departments in a boiler room established to help track votes as they came in. Already, for over a month, Obama’s analysts had been counting ballots from states that allowed citizens to vote early. Each day, the campaign overlaid the lists of early voters released by election authorities with its modeling scores to project how many votes they could claim as their own.

By Election Day, Wagner’s analytic tables turned into predictions. Before the polls opened in Ohio, authorities in Hamilton County, the state’s third-largest and home to Cincinnati, released the names of 103,508 voters who had cast early ballots over the previous month. Wagner sorted them by microtargeting projections and found that 58,379 had individual support scores over 50.1—that is, the campaign’s models predicted that they were more likely than not to have voted for Obama. That amounted to 56.4 percent of the county’s votes, or a raw lead of 13,249 votes over Romney. Early ballots were the first to be counted after Ohio’s polls closed, and Obama’s senior staff gathered around screens in the boiler room to see the initial tally. The numbers settled almost exactly where Wagner had said they would: Obama got 56.6 percent of the votes in Hamilton County. In Florida, he was as close to the mark; Obama’s margin was only two-tenths of a percent off. “After those first two numbers, we knew,” says Bird. “It was dead-on.”

When Obama was reëlected, and by a far larger Electoral College margin than most outsiders had anticipated, his staff was exhilarated but not surprised. The next morning, Mitch Stewart sat in the boiler room, alone, monitoring the lagging votes as they came into Obama’s servers from election authorities in Florida, the last state to name a winner. The presidency was no longer at stake; the only thing that still hung in the balance was the accuracy of the analytics department’s predictions.

The Legacy

A few days after the election, as Florida authorities continued to count provisional ballots, a few staff members were directed, as four years before, to remain in Chicago. Their instructions were to produce another post-mortem report summing up the lessons of the past year and a half. The undertaking was called the Legacy Project, a grandiose title inspired by the idea that the innovations of Obama 2012 should be translated not only to the campaign of the next Democratic candidate for president but also to governance. Obama had succeeded in convincing some citizens that a modest adjustment to their behavior would affect, however marginally, the result of an election. Could he make them feel the same way about Congress?

Simas, who had served in the White House before joining the team, marveled at the intimacy of the campaign. Perhaps more than anyone else at headquarters, he appreciated the human aspect of politics. This had been his first presidential election, but before he became a political operative, Simas had been a politician himself, serving on the city council and school board in his hometown of Taunton, Massachusetts. He ran for office by knocking on doors and interacting individually with constituents (or those he hoped would become constituents), trying to track their moods and expectations.

In many respects, analytics had made it possible for the Obama campaign to recapture that style of politics. Though the old guard may have viewed such techniques as a disruptive force in campaigns, they enabled a presidential candidate to view the electorate the way local candidates do: as a collection of people who make up a more perfect union, each of them approachable on his or her terms, their changing levels of support and enthusiasm open to measurement and, thus, to respect. “What that gave us was the ability to run a national presidential campaign the way you’d do a local ward campaign,” Simas says. “You know the people on your block. People have relationships with one another, and you leverage them so you know the way they talk about issues, what they’re discussing at the coffee shop.”

Few events in American life other than a presidential election touch 126 million adults, or even a significant fraction that many, on a single day. Certainly no corporation, no civic institution, and very few government agencies ever do. Obama did so by reducing every American to a series of numbers. Yet those numbers somehow captured the individuality of each voter, and they were not demographic classifications. The scores measured the ability of people to change politics—and to be changed by it.
With election fever sweeping the U.S., the issue of campaign donations is as contentious as ever. One thing is always true in U.S. politics: “no money, no campaign,” so the search for new and bigger sources of income is hugely important for all candidates. One relatively neglected angle in the debate is what light science can throw on the issue.

Today we get a unique insight thanks to the work of Vincent Traag at the Leiden University in the Netherlands. Traag is a specialist in the properties of complex networks. He has studied the structure of the social network between donors and discovered how it influences the way people make payments to candidates.

The answer is somewhat unexpected. Traag says that a famous social network illusion implies that politicians can collect more by targeting people who are relatively difficult to recruit rather than the easy picks. And this could have dramatic implications for politics.

Traag begins with data gathered by a website called LittleSis, set up by the Public Accountability Initiative. This gathers data from the Federal Election Committee about donations from individuals to political candidates. The site also collects other information about donors, such as the positions people hold in businesses, where they were educated, what organizations they are members of. It also tracks family, social, and other professional links.

In total, LittleSis has data on 120,000 individuals who are together members of over 40,000 organizations, such as businesses, universities, clubs, and so on. It shows who donated, when, and by how much.

This data has allowed Traag to build a network of links between these individuals—a kind of Facebook of political donors. And because each donation is time-stamped, he can calculate how the process of donation spreads through the network like a virus.

Network theorists know that direct links are an important factor in the spread of everything from disease to gossip. But less well understood is the effect of indirect links across a network—clearly a virus cannot spread via a long-distance telephone call or a group e-mail, but gossip certainly can. So what of political donations—how contagious is this behavior?

Traag attempts to tease this issue apart by distinguishing between two different kinds of links. The first is direct links between people who are members of the same family for example. It’s no surprise that these kinds of links increase the likelihood of somebody making a donation. “A person exposed to a single donor is 1.7 times more likely to donate than a person not exposed to any donor,” says Traag, adding that exposure to more donors increases this effect with diminishing returns. (The effects are the same for Democrats and Republicans.)

But the effect of weaker, indirect links is much more surprising. These are links between people in different communities who do not otherwise have a direct link, such as those who went to the same university or who used to work for the same company or are members of the organization and so on.

That distinction allows an interesting form of analysis. Traag asks how the likelihood of a person donating depends on the number of direct connections he or she has to other donors in the network. But he also asks how the likelihood of donation depends on the number of indirect links to other communities.

The answer is something of a surprise. Traag says that weak links to other communities have an even bigger influence on donation behavior. “Exposure to a single donor community makes donation 2.27 times more likely,” he says.

That has significant implications for the way candidates should target donors. Clearly donation behavior is most contagious when individuals experience it among their nearest and dearest and at the same time see evidence of it in more distant communities, such as among business colleagues and so on. “Contagion is especially likely after multiple exposures from different communities or from different types of sources (e.g. family, friends, business partners),” says Traag.

This may be because of an increasingly well-known social-network illusion—that people infer something is popular when they observe that people like it who are both close and distant. However, this is an illusion—it is not possible to infer this status across the whole network from such a sample.

Nevertheless, this “majority illusion” suggests a strategy for maximizing campaign donations. Traag points out that the number of communities that have donated to a candidate is significantly predictive of total fund-raising capabilities, whereas the number of donors is not. “Our findings suggest that appealing to constituencies of diverse backgrounds may actually aid in diffusing support through networks,” he says.

That means targeting people who are generally more difficult to recruit. This group may be less willing to donate in general, but the few who do will have a proportionately greater effect on the rest so that the overall effect is greater.

That’s an idea that could turn politics on its head. It suggests that politicians could garner support by targeting a wide range of different communities, not just a small number of similar ones. “Rather than addressing narrow interests and petty concerns, politicians should appeal to the general population and the greater good,” says Traag.

Imagine that—a political system that targets the general population and the greater good! A dangerous idea, if ever there was one.

The Financial Times has big plans for expanding its content studio into a full-service agency.

Until now, it’s been adept at the delivery and distribution side of branded content, but not creative production. That’s all set to change with last month’s acquisition of content-marketing video specialist Alpha Grid. And, naturally for a paywalled publisher, much of the way forward lies in unlocking more subscriber data to help tailor its content.

Jon Slade, who was promoted to the new role of chief commercial officer two months ago, said cultivating the advertising department into a full-service agency and consultancy is a top priority. “We’re not just a vendor of pink or white space,” he told Digiday, referring to the newspaper’s signature salmon color.

“The advertising industry as a whole is bifurcating, and the vacated middle ground is direct-sold, hand-trafficked, CPM-bought inventory,” he said. “Instead, everyone is moving toward high-touch, rich, deep content solutions at one end, and audience automation, programmatic, hard-core media, at the other end. “The two can work together nicely, but we need to take our ad business away from the middle ground of ‘how many impressions do you want to buy?’”

The FT established its content-marketing operation, called FT Squared, last September. It launched a suite of new “paid posts” and “smart match” formats, which clients including BP and Santander have run with. It ran a series of articles for BP including: “Changes in the World of Energy” and “Why Scientists Give Science a Bad Name” to promote the brand’s “Committed to the U.K.” campaign. Readers have spend a total 230,000 hours with this content, according to the publisher.

Since then, the FT has grown branded-content revenues by 30 percent, accounting for 10 percent of all digital ad revenue, though Slade declined to give the raw numbers. In May, it appointed former FT tech and media editor Ravi Mattu as editorial director of FT Squared.

The addition of Alpha Grid will fill the “gap in its arsenal”: the ability to create better branded content on behalf of clients, according to Slade. Alpha Grid specializes in creating content aimed at global business decision-makers: the FT’s core demographic.

Alpha Grid staff will hot desk at the FT, though once the publisher moves back to its original headquarters at Bracken House near St Paul’s Cathedral, it will free up space for semi-permanent staffers. In total, 14 people now work on FT Squared.

Using subscription data for ad retargeting has been bread and butter at the FT for a while, but it has yet to drill into it to help shape and inform the creation of branded content and help brand partners make decisions around their own content-marketing strategies and media planning.

“The data we yield from the analytics that powers our subscription business is as applicable for own subscription business as it is to our own clients’ ad businesses. My job is to pull all those threads together into a coherent offering for our clients,” he added.

The FT uses advanced analytics systems to power its newsroom and its subscriptions business. It has already had success using real-time editorial data to drive its own subscription marketing plans; now it can apply the same techniques for clients.

“We understand what motivates a reader, what draws them to a piece of content, and deeper thoughts on their media consumption,” said Slade. “We can tell a client what the lead stories are, if it’s something around Brexit, for example, and we can tell them what people are reading and when, how much of it each reads, and what the optimum length of video or text article their content should be.”

The end goal is to have advertisers regard FT.com as a marketing platform, not a place to buy space, which requires scale. “I don’t think scale is something news sites can ever win at,” he added.

It may have its work cut out for it. Charlotte Tice, head of publishing at Mindshare, said publishers can’t afford not to expand their content-marketing offers and that the FT’s subscriber data pot is “gold” and will therefore always attract certain clients. However, though branded content opens up larger budgets than typical display campaigns, they’re harder to get signed off, and there are a swarm of other traditional and non-traditional rivals pitching for the same briefs.

“You could have Google, the FT, Global Radio and JC Decaux, for example, all up for the same pitch, because in branded content, everyone is a competitor,” she said. “It’s a significant investment. There’s, of course, potentially a big pay-off, but if you do a load and they don’t get signed off, that’s very costly.”

BEIRUT-- Airstrikes on villages held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in northern Syria killed at least 56 civilians on Tuesday as intense fighting was underway between the militants and U.S-backed fighters, Syrian opposition activists and the extremist group said.

Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages, Tokhar and Hoshariyeh, which are controlled by ISIS, activists said. The villages are near the ISIS stronghold of Manbij, a town that members of the predominantly Kurdish U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians, including 11 children, were killed in the strikes on the villages, which also wounded dozens. Another activist group, the Local Coordination Committees, said dozens of civilians, mostly families, were killed.

The ISIS-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians - mostly women and children - were killed in Tokhar alone, in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday.

The reports and the disparate casualty tolls could not be independently confirmed because the area is inaccessible to independent media. There was no immediate comment from Washington.

Postings on a Facebook page show images of people, including children, as they were being put in collective grave, purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child, partly covered by a blanket, lying in a grave.

The photographs appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting of the events depicted. Tuesday's casualties come on the heels of similar airstrikes on the ISIS-held town of Manbij on Monday, when at least 15 civilians were reportedly killed.

The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 ISIS fighting positions, seven ISIS vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij.

The Manbij area has seen intense battles between ISIS extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition.

If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters, it will be the biggest strategic defeat for ISIS in Syria since July 2015, when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq, meanwhile, ISIS has been beaten back on several fronts, with Iraqi forces, aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.

During the 2016 RNC (Republican National Convention,) Donald Trump walks out to an elaborate WWE style entrance, to introduce his wife, Melania Trump, before she gave a rousing speech endorsing her husband, Donald. Trump's entrance featured him being illuminated by bright white lights that created sort of a shadow effect. You could see his outline and obviously tell it was him, but you couldn't see his face clearly until he emerged from the light and walked onto the stage. The song which accompanied him was "Champion" by the iconic rock group named "Queen" which was released in 1977.

Thunderstorms that tore through northern Delaware late Monday afternoon left behind downed tree branches, power outages and closed roads.

More than 1,400 Delmarva Power customers across New Castle County were still without power on Tuesday morning. Power was not expected to be restored until late Tuesday.

For some people the storms left behind serious property damage.

James Taylor, 52, was on his way to the Delcastle Recreational Park at about 4:30 p.m., right after the downpour started, to umpire a softball game scheduled to start two hours later.

Driving down McKennans Church Road, he heard the thunder and gusting winds.

"I'm hearing things – boom, boom," he said. "Next thing I know, I get a tree on my windshield."

Taylor was standing in his pressed Army dress uniform – he's a Sergeant First Class – next to his truck, which was surrounded by branches and crushed by a tree. He was coming from the home of an Army veteran who had died, where he was explaining death benefits to the family, Taylor said.

One branch, about 6 inches in diameter, stabbed through the front of the vehicle into the passenger seat.

If someone had been sitting there, that person would be dead, said Mill Creek Fire Company Chief Joe Stewart, who had responded to the scene.

"I just thank God that, for one, there wasn't a passenger," said Taylor, who wasn't hurt in the crash. "And I thank God I was able to stop."

At least 10 trees in the area had been brought down by strong winds, Stewart said.

Down the road, Linda Schiavi had gotten lucky, too. She usually parks her car in the driveway, but she moved it to the curb during the sweltering heat on Monday afternoon so it would be under the shade of a large tree in her front yard.

The wind knocked down a major branch right in front of the car, leaving just a few twigs on the hood.

"Life," she shrugged, smiling. "That's the way it is."

Power outages were reported across the county, with the number of people affected reaching into the thousands Monday, according to Delmarva Power. To report an outage, call the company at 800-898-8042 or go online here.

Some traffic lights around the county were also out, leaving traffic backed up at certain intersections.

In other areas, roads were closed down either because of fallen power lines or minor flooding.

Airport Road, near New Castle, was shut down because a small section was covered in several inches of water, which had gotten two cars stuck, said Titus Neal, one of the many DelDOT workers dispatched to manage storm damage around the county.

The severe storms lasted through about 5 p.m. with wind gusts reaching up to 60 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service.

Residents all over the state took to Facebook to report on the conditions in their neighborhoods.

Kristina Rice sent a photo of lightning striking in front of her while she was in her car and wrote, "God found Pokemon, he wins!"

Dennis C. Walters wrote on Facebook that his home in Dartmouth Woods was shaking.

Others reported heavy winds and pounding rain from Hockessin to Newark to Dover. Power outages were noted by Facebook posters in Heritage Park, parts of Wilmington and Newark, along Milltown Road, Old Capital Trail, Buckley, along Route 40 from Salem Church Road to Governor's Square, and Wilmington Manor in New Castle. Power lines were reported down on Kirkwood Highway.

Since most deaths due to floods happen in automobiles, the weather service urges people not to drive in areas where the road is covered by water because it is usually deeper than it appears. One foot of flowing water can be strong enough to sweep a vehicle off the road.

Following Melania Trump's speech Monday night at the Republican National Convention, several social media users pointed out a section that was startlingly similar to one the country has heard before — it came from current first lady Michelle Obama at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.

It is, of course, common for political speeches to be filled with platitudes like both women used — values, morals, getting what you want in life. But comparing the two speeches, the overlap amounts to more than passing similarity of a few phrases.

The section of Trump's in question is one minute long, and about half of the words in it are the same as Obama's.

The parts that are the same have been bolded by NPR below. The videos begin playing at the comments that are in question.

Melania Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention:

From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life. That your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise. That you treat people with respect. They thought and showed me values and morals in their daily life. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son, and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. Because -- Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.

Michelle Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention:

And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: like, you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond; that you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them and even if you don't agree with them. And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values and to pass them on to the next generation, because we want our children — and all children in this nation — to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them.

In response to press inquiries about the similarities in the two speeches, the senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, issued this statement:

In writing her beautiful speech, Melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking. Melania's immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success.

Ulfat, Nazir and Sameer have not been around for 20 years but they already bear the scars of a battle.They are some of the victims recovering in Srinagar's SMHS Hospital.Ulfat, 18, was out on the street looking for her brother when protests broke out. "I was going home when a cop shot me," said Ulfat, a class 12 student."There were protest going on and I was near a house when policemen came charging at me and shot me at the leg," said Sameer, also a class 12 student.Sixteen-year-old Nazir also said he was shot by a police officer.In the 10 days since the killing of terrorist Burhan Wani, more than 2,100 civilians have been injured in firing by security forces as protests have bruised and bloodied the streets of Kashmir. Of these, around 125 were hit by bullets."Bullet injury is more dangerous as far as orthopaedics goes. But pellet injury is more dangerous as far as eye injury goes," said Abdul Rashid Budoo, a medical superintendent at the Bone and Joint Hospital in Srinagar.The story is no different on the other side of the trenches. At the Army base hospital in Srinagar, 23 Jammu and Kashmir policemen and paramilitary soldiers are undergoing treatment. Fifteen of them splinter injuries others injured in stone pelting.Security forces say terrorists are hiding behind protesters and attacking the forces but firing is the last resort when all non-lethal means fail to control the crowds."There are situations where the crowds are attacking. They are not demonstrating, they are not protesting, they are attacking. So when a small party of policemen or a police post with seven eight people is attacked by a crowd of thousands of people, then this pattern does not work. They don't have tear-smoke everywhere.Senior officer or magistrates are not available and there is no way of going through this so firing takes place," said MK Khajuria, former Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police.On Friday, as they were dealing with violent protesters in Kulgam, terrorists hurled grenades and fired indiscriminately injuring seven of their men, police said. Three other civilians received gunshot and splinter injuries and one civilian was killed in firing by terrorists, they said.Mudassir, one of the policemen critically injured in that attack, is recovering in the intensive care unit or ICU."The splinters in his case have gone into abdomen, in his chest cavity and there is a splinter which has gone behind his left ear into the skull and is still lodged in the brain tissue," Brigadier MS Tevatia, Commandant of the Army Base Hospital told NDTV.Similar grenade attacks have taken place in Kupwara and Nowhatta in the past few days. Those injured say their protection gear is just inadequate for grenades and other fire arms.As tensions in Kashmir refuse to die down, the cost of the conflict only keeps mounting.
A spin-out company from the University of Oxford called Oxbotica has developed a new software system for making regular cars into driverless vehicles.

The system, called Selenium, can ingest data from visual cameras, laser scanners, or radar systems. It then uses a series of algorithms to establish where the "it" is, what surrounds it, and how to move. “It takes any vehicle and makes it into an autonomous vehicle,” explains Paul Newman, a professor at the University of Oxford and cofounder of Oxbotica. That sounds ambitious, but he’s being serious: the team plans for the software to be used to control not just autonomous cars, but warehouse robots, forklifts, and self-driving public transport vehicles.

Most systems being developed by other manufacturers rely on building a system that is robust enough to handle driving from the moment they are first switched on. Tesla’s Autopilot, for example, makes use of onboard cameras and image analysis to control the car on highways. But its reliability has come into question after a series of recent crashes.

Oxbotica’s software gradually acquires data about the routes along which a vehicle is driven and learns how to react by analyzing the way its human driver acts. “When you buy your autonomous car and drive off the (lot), it will know nothing,” says Ingmar Posner, an associate professor at Oxford and another of Oxbotica’s cofounders. “But at some point it will decide that it knows where it is, that its perception system has been trained by the way you’ve been driving, and it can then offer autonomy.”

The company explains that the software provides two primary functions: localize the vehicle in space, and perceive what’s happening around it. Based on those two feeds, a central planner can determine how the car should move. Both localization and perception systems rely on sensors dotted about the vehicle, the choice of which depends on application: Newman suggests that a warehouse forklift may use just use cheap cameras, while a car could make use of all kinds of sensors.

Selenium can compare on-the-fly sensor readings with those stored away in prior maps from previous journeys in similar conditions. “If you take it out in the snow and it’s not seen it before, it keeps the ideas of snowy-ness around for the next time,” Newman says. Then it can identify image features—such as details on buildings or placement of street furniture—to localize the vehicle in the wider world. Meanwhile laser data, due to its high resolution, can be used to more accurately localize the car, especially in low-visibility conditions when cameras can falter.

The team initially teaches Selenium to recognize, say, cars and humans by providing it with a labeled training set from which it can learn. But over time it also learns from the driver. “If a human’s driving and they pass straight through what the car thought was a human, the software can learn from that,” Posner says. The system uses similar prior knowledge and continual learning to work out, for instance, which parts of a surface it can safely drive on or how traffic signals are changing.

The result is a vehicle that can gain a deep understanding of the routes it drives regularly. That, Posner says, means that the software isn’t simply trying to do a mediocre job wherever it’s placed—instead, it does an excellent job where it’s learned to drive. I took a spin in a modified Renault Twizy that had been fitted with lasers, cameras, and a large computer powered by Selenium. It felt much like being driven by a confident human driver, with smooth but assertive acceleration, braking, and steering—though there were no hazards on the simple loop we drove.

Oxbotica’s software is set to be tested in two real-world settings in the near future: in the self-driving public transport vehicles of the GATEway project in Greenwich, London, and the LUTZ Pathfinder driverless pods being tested in Milton Keynes, U.K. When pressed, Newman explained that the company is already working with auto manufacturers, though he wasn’t able to say which ones, nor say when the technology might be rolled out in cars.

Despite recent investigations into Tesla’s autonomous systems casting somewhat of a shadow over self-driving car technology, those working in the sector are clearly pressing ahead with their work. Oxbotica isn’t alone in launching software: Nissan also announced its new ProPilot driver aid this week, too. The two systems are very different, but their arrivals suggest that the race to achieve automotive autonomy shows no signs of slowing.
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick recently gave a TED Talk suggesting that Uber “can cut congestion, pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars; and we can do it with the technology that’s in our pockets.” He went on to state that in the United States “we spend 7 billion hours a year, wasted, sitting in traffic. 160 billion dollars in lost productivity…and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint is spewed out in the air by those cars that we’re sitting in.”

Uber is revolutionizing transportation by making the experience dead simple. Here at DigitalGlobe, we are thrilled to be joining them in that revolution. Today we are announcing a multi-year, global partnership with Uber to supply high resolution satellite imagery. This imagery will help improve the Uber experience for riders and drivers around the world. Specifically Uber will leverage DigitalGlobe’s industry leading constellation of sensors to access imagery and location intelligence to help identify and improve pick-up and drop-off locations.

At DigitalGlobe, we’ve spent the last decade developing advanced technology that scans the Earth with the highest accuracy and resolution in both visible and non-visible wavelengths. This capability gives our customers an unprecedented ability to understand the environment in which they operate, and in turn, to create new and disruptive services that change the way we live. DigitalGlobe is looking forward to partnering with an innovator like Uber to use this transformative technology to improve transportation options for riders and drivers around the world.
China’s auto industry regulator said it’s working with police to formulate rules governing the testing of autonomous cars, warning automakers that they shouldn’t test their self-driving vehicles on highways before the regulations are released.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and police have a preliminary draft of the rules, She Weizhen, head of the ministry’s autos department, said in a forum in Beijing. She didn’t give a detailed time frame on when the regulations will be finalized.

Governments around the world are balancing pressure from companies to encourage innovation in the field of autonomous driving without compromising safety standards. In China, the push for self-driving vehicles is also part of a broader state initiative urging manufacturers to upgrade their technology as lower-cost countries emerge and compete for labor-intensive factory jobs.

A moratorium on highway testing may set back efforts by companies aiming to introducing automated driving in China, as local testing allows them to take into account different traffic conditions, driving habits and signage. The field has come under increased scrutiny after the U.S. began investigating a fatal accident involving a Model S sedan driver using Tesla Motors Inc.’s Autopilot system in May.

Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. completed a 1,200-mile trip in April with a self-driving car that employed cameras and radar. The chairmen of Internet search provider Baidu Inc. and automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. in March urged the government to speed up the drafting of a legal framework for the technology.

The logo of the Wikileaks website is pictured on a smartphone in this picture illustration taken in Tokyo November 29, 2010.

ISTANBUL Turkey has blocked access to the WikiLeaks website, the telecoms watchdog said on Wednesday, hours after it leaked thousands of ruling party emails just as Ankara grapples with the aftermath of a failed military coup.

Around 50,000 soldiers, police, judges and teachers have been suspended or detained since the attempted coup on the weekend, and Turkey's Western allies have expressed concern over the crackdown's reach.

WikiLeaks on Tuesday released nearly 300,000 emails from the AK Party dating from 2010 to July 6 this year. Obtained before the attempted coup, the date of their publication was brought forward "in response to the government's post-coup purges", WikiLeaks said on its website.

The source of the emails was not connected to the coup plotters or to a rival political party or state, WikiLeaks said.

Founded by Julian Assange, WikiLeaks publishes leaked material, mostly from governments. In 2010, the organization published classified U.S. military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.

Turkey's Telecommunications Communications Board said on Wednesday that an "administrative measure" had been taken against the website - the term it commonly uses when blocking access to sites.

Turkey routinely uses Internet shutdowns in response to political events, which critics and human rights advocates see as part of a broader attack on the media and freedom of expression.

Britain will not trigger Article 50 to start the process of leaving the European Union until Scotland’s position in negotiations is clear, Theresa May has signaled.

Though the UK voted to leave the European Union by 52 per cent to 48 per cent, Scotland, along with Northern Ireland and London, overwhelmingly voted to stay.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will seek to ensure Scotland remains in the EU; she has not ruled out a second independence referendum.

Theresa May's first speech as PM: Unity with Scotland and Ireland is important

The Prime Minister said after a meeting with Ms Sturgeon she would not formally start the process of leaving the bloc until there was a coherent “UK approach” to negotiations.

“Scotland’s very important to me. When I stood on the steps of Downing Street on Wednesday I made clear that I believe in the United Kingdom,” she said.

“I’ve just had an excellent meeting with the First Minister – a very positive and constructive meeting.

“I'm willing to listen to options and I've been very clear with the first minister today that I want the Scottish government to be fully engaged in our discussions.

An important test of gene therapy in Italy is bringing joy and heartbreak to families afflicted with a rare brain disease by offering affected siblings unequal shots at life.

Amy Price, an American from Omaha, Nebraska, says that in 2011 she did something no mother should have to, leaving one sick toddler behind at a rented flat in Milan with caretakers while accompanying her younger infant for a life-saving treatment at an Italian hospital.

Her son Giovanni is now six and healthy, but her daughter Liviana went untreated and passed away in 2013.

The study, at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, is proving dramatically effective in stopping metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD, an inherited disorder that strikes in childhood and destroys the brain’s white matter, leading to paralysis and dementia.

The therapy involves adding a correct copy of a single gene to a child’s bone marrow. But it only works well if it’s given before symptoms develop: by the time most children, including Liviana, are diagnosed it’s too late. The exception is when a family is alerted by one sick child that others are at risk. Then genetic and biochemical tests can discover if there’s a disease threat in younger children.

“It is gut wrenching; you lose one child and save another,” says Dean Suhr, president of the MLD Foundation, a charity based in Oregon. “That is a decision that no parent should make, but that is what has happened many times in this trial.”

The treatment appears to be the first gene therapy designed to act preventively, almost similar to a vaccine. Given early to infants, before scary symptoms set in at around two years of age, it appears to freeze or entirely prevent the rapid onset of the disease.

Italian doctors presented results on nine children in June in the Lancet. Eight of them had their disease progression interrupted or have reached school age with no illness at all. Alessandra Biffi, who initiated the trial in 2010 and is now a gene-therapy specialist with Harvard Medical School, says it’s still too soon to declare a permanent cure because the children haven’t been tracked for long enough.

Italian doctors surround Giovanni Price, an American infant who was the second patient to undergo a new gene therapy for an ultra-rare brain disease.

“At a minimum, there is a substantial delay of the onset of the disease,” says Biffi.

Gene therapy is making a historic jump from science project to real medicine. After three decades of false starts, the first curative gene treatment, for an immune deficiency disorder, was approved in Europe this year. Just like the MLD treatment, it was developed at the gene-therapy center in Milan, a hotbed of DNA science supported by national TV telethons that raise money featuring cases like that of the Prices’, a family with eight children, three of which were diagnosed with MLD, and which scrapes by on a house re-modeler's income.

Both treatments have been purchased by British drug giant GlaxoSmithKline, which is pursuing commercialization of the therapies. By adding correct DNA code to cells, gene therapy has the potential to erase devastating illnesses with a one-time treatment. Andrew Shenker, the GSK vice president directing the MLD program, says gene and cell treatments could become as important as all of today’s pills and infusions.

The data from the siblings is especially powerful because each pair has the exact same DNA errors in their cells, and roughly similar genetic makeups. One therefore acts as an “untreated” control showing exactly what happens without gene therapy, and how well the other does by comparison.

Based on such potent data, GSK says it will be able to seek approval for the MLD treatment in 2017, even though so few children have ever received it. The paper’s concluding line recognizes the older siblings who acted as sentinels: “In memory of Baily, Valentina, Carlos, Dennis, Liviana, Mustafa, Randa, and Amany,” it reads.

Price still remembers the exact moment in 2010 when she noticed that Liviana’s right leg hung at a strange angle. Then the three-year-old began getting chills. It was the beginning of a parent’s nightmare as the toddler started hitting childhood milestones, except in reverse. Price noted everything on her blog: the day Liviana stopped walking. The last time she said mommy. Her last big smile.

They didn’t know it at first, but both Price and her husband, Brad, had one defective copy of a gene called ARSA. And because Liviana inherited both errors, and had no working copies, her body didn’t make an enzyme needed to clear certain molecules, called sulfatides, from her nerve cells. That destroyed their ability to maintain connections to other nerves.

The disease is very rare, affecting maybe one in 50,000 children born in a year. But the Price’s kids would all have a 25 percent chance. Doctors quickly tested the others—just three at the time—and Price almost blacked out when she learned her newborn Giovanni harbored the same genetic death sentence. Yet within days she had located the Italian trial and got Giovanni enrolled.

Alessandra Biffi, director of the gene-therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.

“Without her we wouldn’t have known,” Price says. “Liviana was given to us to save Giovanni.”

Children undergoing the treatment are dosed with busulfan, a chemo drug that destroys most of their bone marrow. But some marrow is removed and set aside first so doctors can use a virus to insert a working copy of the ARSA gene. After that, the corrected bone marrow is returned, and some cells make it to the brain where they turn into specialized glia, cells that manufacture the ARSA enzyme.

Parents are desperate to get in the study, including with children already showing symptoms. “They are asking to be treated. Absolutely, yes,” says Biffi. However, she says they are being refused for scientific reasons as the treatment takes at least months to have an effect, and isn’t expected to help much if a person’s brain is already in fast decline.

Instead, Italian doctors believe the earlier in life the gene is replaced, the better the results will be. In the future, says Allessandro Aiuti, the chief Italian doctor, MLD could be added to a list of rare diseases tested for at birth so children could immediately be spotted and have the chance for gene therapy. Other diseases might be treated the same way, making gene therapy like a childhood vaccine.

A pilot study got underway in Washington state this May of whether it’s feasible to detect MLD as part of newborn screening, which in the U.S. involves taking a spot of blood with a heel-stick and checking if the infant has any of about 30 to 50 metabolic disorders. Such inexpensive public health tests aren’t DNA tests; an MLD blood test would instead look for high sulfatide levels, but so far it’s not clear how accurate such a test would be. That is what the pilot study will find out.

The Italians covered the cost of Giovanni's treatment and the Prices’ expenses, too, with money raised by the Telethon Foundation. But it has been difficult for Price to travel to Italy twice a year for medical follow-ups. When she once refused to return to Milan for a checkup, two Italian doctors instead flew to Omaha to test Giovanni’s bone marrow.

Price also disagreed with the Italians’ advice to get a prenatal genetic test during her two subsequent pregnancies to learn in advance if the fetuses would be affected, as she wouldn’t consider abortion. She had four more children, three of them in 2014 when she delivered natural fraternal triplets (there are one-in-8,100 odds of that). One of them, Cecilia, also had inherited the MLD genes. The Italians accepted the second baby into the study and treated her, too, at nine months of age. She is now two.

Giovanni has grown into a normal six-year old. He has already outlived Liviana, who was five and a half when she died. He remembers her as his “best friend.” When she was sick, he’d put toys in her hands even though she couldn’t play with them anymore. His mother says she has not explained to Giovanni that the reason he goes to Italy is because he has the same disease.

“I don’t want him to think that he is going to die, too,” Price says. “Someday, I will give him the conversation that he had the treatment and she didn’t, and that will make him sad. But those are big conversations to have with a six-year-old. Right now, no one would know standing next to him on the street that he really shouldn’t be here.”

Is the treatment a fix for good? No one can say. Cecilia is doing well, and so is Giovanni, who has aced his blood exams and kiddie IQ tests. He loves fancy clothes and cowboy boots. But Price says she is terrified that every growing pain or stumble is a sign the disease is starting. “I don’t want to say if I think it’s forever or not,” says Price. “I don’t want to jinx it.”
Twitter has secured the rights to stream live video content from the NBA starting next season. It’s just not the content you’re thinking of.

The two sides have agreed on a new deal in which the NBA will create two “live original programs” (i.e., TV shows) that it will stream exclusively on Twitter. It will also double the number of NBA game highlights it posts to Twitter-owned properties, including Vine, and those highlights include ads that Twitter and the NBA make revenue from.

What Twitter is not getting, though, is the most valuable content the NBA has to offer: Actual game broadcasts. Recode reported earlier this month that the two sides were talking about a deal, and has heard from multiple sources that Twitter inquired about game broadcasts. Obviously that didn’t happen.

Still, Twitter is essentially getting its own NBA TV shows, which is the first made-for-Twitter content we can think of. (Besides all the tweets we like to send, of course.)

What we know about these shows is next to nothing. They are described in the press release as “weekly” programs, and the first show is listed as a “pregame show.”

And that’s about it.

We don’t know who will host or star in either show. We don’t know who will produce them, although Turner seems like a possible candidate given it handles most of the NBA’s other digital content, like its app and website. And we don’t know how they’ll be monetized, although some sort of pre-roll or midstream ads seem most likely.

The idea here for the NBA is to drum up excitement for its actual TV broadcasts, where the league and its broadcast partners make a lot of money from TV advertisers.

Twitter’s mission, on the other hand, is to drum up excitement for Twitter. It’s no secret the company is dealing with issues around its growth. Now it’s collecting all kinds of livestreaming content around live events, like the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and Wimbledon, to try to jump-start interest from new users.

The NBA deal is just the latest in a string of partnerships Twitter has announced in the past month. Twitter has promised the league an undisclosed sum of money in advertising sales for the shows. After that guarantee is met, the two sides will share any additional advertising revenue.*

It’s still early days for Google’s modular smartphone effort, but developers and enthusiasts are already thinking about the swappable components they may build.

From afar, the device in Garrett Kinsman’s palm looked like a prototype of Google’s Project Ara modular smartphone: a shiny slab of a handset composed of thin, removable orange squares—each representing a different function that the user could easily swap—flanked by the golden-brown ribs of the internal skeleton that held the squares together.

Model phone: This 3-D printed model of a Project Ara phone, complete with removable modules, was created by Garrett Kinsman.

It wasn’t improbable, as Google had just shown off an actual, though not functional, prototype phone that mid-April morning at a developers’ conference for the forthcoming smartphone, which Kinsman was attending.

Yet it was actually a 3-D-printed plastic model, which Kinsman, an 18-year-old college student from Rochester, New York, modeled using early images of a Project Ara prototype and then convinced the engineering department at his school to print. Kinsman held it in his hands, sliding the squares in and out, showing how simple it was to switch them on a whim.

“I wanted to play with it—I wanted to actually hold something, mess around with it,” says Kinsman, who’s working with a company called OpenMod Wireless that hopes to help companies build a range of modules.

Kinsman is one of many Project Ara enthusiasts who are considering making modules for the forthcoming smartphone, which is being developed by Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group (a unit of Motorola that Google kept when it recently sold the company to computer maker Lenovo) and a number of other companies (see “Why Google’s Modular Smartphone Might Actually Succeed”).

Project Ara’s goal is to create an inexpensive smartphone that users can customize and upgrade according to their needs and budgets; you might buy a second battery to get better battery life if you’re far from a charger, or carry several different camera modules to get just the right shots at a concert. Modules will be held in place by electropermanent magnets and will be swappable without turning off the phone.

Google expects to roll out the first Ara device early next year. It is targeting both the majority of the planet where smartphones aren’t yet widely used, and touting the customization potential for tech-savvy users. Paul Eremenko, the head of Project Ara, says the basic Ara handset—a so-called “gray phone” that includes an endoskeleton, display, Wi-Fi capabilities, battery, and processor and runs Android—will cost about $50 to make, though it’s not yet clear what the sale price will be.

There’s no functional Ara prototype for developers to mess around with yet, just a downloadable module developers’ kit that includes reference designs and hardware specifications.

And yet, there’s no shortage of ideas for ways to modify the basic Ara hardware with add-on modules, ranging from medical devices to DIY-like modules to which users can assign functions.

Eric Blanchard, a senior design engineer at satellite tracking device maker Spot, is contemplating a satellite communications module that would let hikers in remote areas alert loved ones of their location. A Spot module would allow people who want the feature to add it to their existing phone instead of buying the company’s stand-alone device to do the same thing. It could also open the door to using the company’s technology as a satellite modem for smartphones, he says. This could allow users in areas with spotty or no wireless network service to access the Internet.

Health modules are also being mulled. Derek Rinderknecht, a senior scientist at Caltech who studies noninvasive methods for predicting heart failure, is interested in the idea of a module that could give users real-time information about their heart health. He can envision a module being especially helpful in developing countries, where cell phones can be more common than medical instruments.

“You could have a village where there was a set of health-care modules, and instead of somebody having to travel four or five days to get to see a doctor, they can at least decide whether or not they need to make that trip,” Rinderknecht says.

At least one developer is interested in creating modules that hardware hackers could customize. Chris Taylor, head engineer at SparkFun Electronics, which sells electronics parts for hackers and hobbyists, wants to build a blank, open-source module containing an Arduino microcontroller. This could make it easy for nearly anyone to assign whatever functions they want to it, and to quickly and cheaply build prototypes, he says.

What does he hope they’ll build?

“Break the phone. Do something weird,” he says. “That’s obviously the lunatic fringe, but the idea is to give people that power.”

Beyond Project Ara’s smartphone focus, there’s a possibility that Google’s support for ever-changeable electronics could lead to more modular gadgets. Rocky Lin, chief engineer at automotive electronics maker Alpine Electronics’ Silicon Valley development office, is interested in exploring how, say, a modular console might work in a car where drivers could easily swap in and out parts for the stereo, navigation, and other functions.

For now, though, there are still plenty of questions, such as how difficult it will be to build modules and how much it will cost to develop them—both big concerns for small companies and individual developers.

“I’m very keen on the idea, but as it stands, I don’t know that I’ll be the first one out the door with an Ara product,” Rinderknecht says.

The Obama administration is making a new large-scale effort to encourage deployment and use of rooftop solar power on homes.

Numerous agencies announced new or strengthened coordinated efforts Tuesday aimed at increasing solar installations in houses owned by low- and moderate-income Americans, including a new goal for solar installations and a policy change to increase access to a key financing mechanism for solar power and energy efficiency.

“This is an approach that cuts across the government to try to take advantage of the fact that the cost of renewable technologies has come down dramatically during President Obama’s tenure, and we want to advantage of that a try to encourage more homeowners to actually benefit directly from that dynamic,” Brian Deese, a top adviser to Obama, told reporters.

The administration is dubbing the effort the “Clean Energy for All Americans Initiative.”

The initiative marks another major push for solar power, which the administration has sought to highlight as a significant bright spot not only in the fight against climate change but also in economic and job development.

Generating capacity in the solar industry has skyrocketed under Obama, growing more than threefold from 2008 to 2015. Meanwhile, costs have fallen dramatically and job growth greatly outpaces that in the rest of the economy.

Still, solar power is a small sliver of the country’s total electricity generation, representing only 0.6 percent last year, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The most significant piece of Tuesday’s announcement is a policy change to expand access to the Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program, which allows homeowners to install renewable and energy efficiency projects at no upfront cost, paying the costs over time through taxes.

The Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs will now allow some people using those agencies’ financing mechanisms to buy houses with existing tax debts under PACE. The administration expects that will make it easier both to sell and buy homes with those improvements.

“That’ll unlock a significant sum of money, and help tens of thousands of homeowners actually be part of putting renewable energy in some form in their homes,” California Gov. Jerry Brown (D), a strong supporter of the program, told reporters about the announcement.

“At the local level, there will be more lending money available, and therefore, there will be more solar installations, more energy retrofits in buildings.”

The administration is setting a new goal for low-income solar installations. It wants 1 gigawatt of solar capacity on low- and moderate-income homes by 2020, up from the 100 megawatt goal it previously set for low-income housing that receives federal support.

The Department of Energy is also putting new effort into its project to train solar workers by launching a new networking program. That department’s also unveiling a competitive grant program for communities to develop innovating ways to expand solar access.
It was therefore a welcome surprise when the much-criticised RV144 trial reported some degree of efficacy in September 2009, the first vaccine efficacy trial ever to do so.1 However the result hovered tantalisingly close to the boundary of statistical insignificance, and exactly how the vaccine exerted its effect is still the subject of study.

RV144 compared vaccine to placebo in 16,402 adults, starting in 2003 and ending in 2006. It recruited adults aged 18 to 30 in two provinces of Thailand with high HIV prevalence but did not specifically target people at high risk of HIV infection.

The vaccine combined a ‘prime’ vaccine called ALVAC‐HIV (vCP1521) with a boost of the AIDSVAX gp120 vaccine, an envelope protein segment from HIV subtypes B and E. VaxGen, IDSVAX’s original manufacturers, had dissolved soon after the original AIDSVAX trials but executives from VaxGen went on to form Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases, a non-profit organisation. The presence of AIDSVAX in the vaccination regimen was one reason why many vaccine experts had not expected the trial to show a positive result.

ALVAC(R)-HIV, developed by Sanofi Pasteur, consists of a viral vector containing genetically engineered versions of three HIV genes (env, gag and pro). The ALVAC vector is an inert form of canarypox, a bird virus, which cannot cause disease or replicate in humans; it has been used in trials of cancer vaccines too.

The prime-boost combination of ALVAC(R)-HIV and AIDSVAX(R) B/E lowered the rate of HIV infection by 31.2% compared with placebo. This reduction was statistically significant, meaning that the possibility of the result being due to chance is low, but the confidence intervals for the estimate in the reduction in risk were wide (p=0.039, 95% confidence interval 1.1%-51.1%). This means that there was a 95% chance that the ‘true’ vaccine efficacy lies somewhere between these limits.

Seventy-four placebo recipients became infected with HIV compared to 51 in the vaccine regimen arm. The vaccine regimen had no effect on the amount of virus in the blood of volunteers who became HIV-infected during the study.

The results were surprising to many. In a press conference call after the results were announced, Colonel Nelson Michael, Director of the US Military HIV Research Programme (MHRP), which funded 25% of the $119 million trial, said that the most surprising and probably significant aspect of the result was that the vaccine appeared to produce a mild protective effect while producing no effect on the viral load in those who were infected.

“We are humbled by this finding,” he said. “This may have turned several key assumptions in HIV vaccine research on their heads.” He added that the trial showed that “human experimentation trumps everything we do in animals and test tubes.”

What Michael was referring to is that the RV144 trial consisted of two vaccines with two modes of action. The ‘prime’ vaccine, ALVAC, consisted of HIV genes contained in a canarypox virus vector. This model of vaccine delivery was designed to stimulate a cellular immune response. This does not prevent initial infection, but the scientific model – supported by data from some monkey studies - was that the cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs or CD8 cells) thereby generated would subsequently reduce HIV proliferation, contain viral load, and slow or stop progression to AIDS.

ALVAC appears to have made no difference to viral load at all, a finding at least in harmony with the failure of the STEP trial. But at the start of RV144 study, CTL vaccines appeared promising.

AIDSVAX, on the other hand, was designed to produce an antibody response against the gp120 protein on HIV’s surface, a concept thought to have been discredited in 2003, just after RV144 started, when it failed its earlier trial. The assumption was that HIV’s genetic hypervariability would mean that any antibody response would be hopelessly specific; at the time HIV research pioneer Dr Robert Gallo said: “This is not a vaccine approach that was based on science.”

Nonetheless what RV144 appears to have done is block infection without containing viral load in those infected, which looks like an antibody response, though Nelson Michael added that a longer-term study, RV152, was following up a proportion of trial participants to see if there were longer-term effects on viral load.

When asked what was causing the vaccine’s efficacy, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Alliergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) commented: “Simply, we don’t know. We did not see broadly neutralising antibody responses, though there is an indication of a small antibody response. We also saw a lympho-proliferative response but didn’t see an increase in CTLs (CD8 cells).

"We may not even have started to measure the correct immune parameters in the body that in fact indicate protection against HIV.”

Fauci said there were a number of further questions left unanswered by the trial. These included:

Was the vaccine’s effect durable or would further boosters be needed?

Are there ways of improving this model’s efficacy?

Would we see similar results in high-risk populations such as men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, and high-risk heterosexual people?

Regarding the last question, MHRP Deputy Director Jerome Kim said that, contrary to some reports, RV144 did not exclude high-risk people. At baseline a small number of participants did turn out to be MSM and sex workers. The trial was designed to vaccinate a “community sample”, in other words a truly representative cross-section of the Thai population, “ranging from people at high risk to people at no risk”.

However, Kim also speculated, one reason for the positive result may have been that “the average intensity of exposure to HIV may have been lower than in high-risk populations…we know a sufficiently large inoculum of virus can overcome any vaccine-generated response.”
Statement of the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee on the WADA Independent Person Report

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) received yesterday the World Anti-Doping Agency’s “Independent Person Report”.

“The findings of the report show a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games. Therefore, the IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organisation implicated,” IOC President Thomas Bach said.

Today, the IOC Executive Board (EB) expressed its appreciation of the work of the “Independent Person” (IP), Mr Richard McLaren. The IOC fully supports his request to continue and finalise his work, in particular since so far the “compressed timeline of the IP investigation did not permit compilation of data to establish an anti-doping rule violation” (IP Report page 4).

The International Sports Organisations will now have to evaluate the IP Report and then take the appropriate measures, according to their respective rules.

1. This means for the IOC that, following Rule 59 of the Olympic Charter, the EB has today started disciplinary actions related to the involvement of officials within the Russian Ministry of Sports and other persons mentioned in the report because of violations of the Olympic Charter and the World Anti-Doping Code. To accelerate this procedure, the IOC EB has established a Disciplinary Commission and has, following Bye-law 1 to Rule 59 of the Olympic Charter, delegated the task of establishing the facts and granting the hearings required by Bye-law 3 to Rule 59, and by natural justice.

As members of this Disciplinary Commission the following people have been appointed:

Guy Canivet (Chair) (Vice-Chair of the IOC Ethics Commission and former member of the French Constitutional Court)

Robin Mitchell (Vice-Chair of the IOC Medical and Scientific Commission, Member of the IOC Ethics Commission)

Yang Yang (Athletes’ representative on the IOC Ethics Commission)

Andrew Ryan (Executive Director of ASOIF)

Dr Wolfgang Schobersberger (Representative of the International Winter Sport Federations, Former Head of Medical for the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2013 in Schladming)

The Commission can refer to any external expertise and support to fulfil its mandate.

2. With regard to the participation of Russian athletes in the Olympic Games Rio 2016, the IOC will carefully evaluate the IP Report. It will explore the legal options with regard to a collective ban of all Russian athletes for the Olympic Games 2016 versus the right to individual justice. In this respect, the IOC will have to take the CAS decision on 21 July 2016 concerning the IAAF rules into consideration, as well as the World Anti-Doping Code and the Olympic Charter.

3. Given the urgency of the matter the IOC EB has already taken the following provisional measures:

The IOC will not organise or give patronage to any sports event or meeting in Russia. This includes plans for the European Games 2019 organised by the European Olympic Committees (EOC).

The IOC will not grant any accreditation to any official of the Russian Ministry of Sport or any person implicated in the IP Report for the Games of the XXXI Olympiad Rio 2016.

The IOC will initiate reanalysis, including forensic analysis, and a full inquiry into all Russian athletes who participated in the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014 and their coaches, officials and support staff. For this purpose, a specific Disciplinary Commission is set up under the chairmanship of Mr Denis Oswald. Following the report of this Commission, the IOC EB will impose all the appropriate sanctions.

Because of the detailed references to the manipulation of samples during the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014 the IOC asks all International Olympic Winter Sports Federations to freeze their preparations for major events in Russia, such as World Championships, World Cups or other major international competitions under their responsibility, and to actively look for alternative organisers.

The IOC asks all IFs for a full inquiry and, in case of implication in infringements of the World Anti-Doping Code, sanctions against Russian National Federations by the respective IF. Such inquiries should be coordinated with the work of the IP, Mr Richard McLaren.

These provisional measures apply until 31 December 2016. They will be reviewed by the IOC EB at its meeting in December 2016.

4. The EB reiterates and supports the measure already announced by the Olympic Summit on 21 June 2016 to reverse the “presumption of innocence” of athletes from Russia with regard to doping. This means that the eligibility of each Russian athlete will have to be decided by his or her International Federation (IF) based on an individual analysis of his or her international anti-doping record. The EB also took note of the actions already being undertaken by the IFs in cooperation with WADA with regard to targeted international tests of Russian athletes in accordance with the declaration of the Olympic Summit.

5. In this context, the IOC asks WADA to extend the mandate of the IP, Mr Richard McLaren, to communicate the names of Russian athletes implicated in the “Disappearing Positive Methodology” and the alleged manipulation of the doping tests performed by the Sochi laboratory to the respective International Federations and, where appropriate, to the IOC, in order to allow them to take swift action.

6. Since, for the IOC as an international non-governmental organisation, the Russian Ministry of Sports and its subordinated organisations such as the Center of Sports Preparations of National Teams of Russia (CSP) and the Russian Federal Research Center of Physical Culture and Sport (VNIIFK) are beyond its reach, it will forward the results of its inquiries to UNESCO and WADA to take further measures and sanctions in application of the UNESCO “Convention against Doping in Sport“ and the World Anti-Doping Code.

7. The IOC EB notes with great concern the deficiencies revealed by the IP, Mr Richard McLaren, in the fight against doping. Therefore the IOC reiterates the call of the Olympic Summit on 21 June 2016 to fully review the anti-doping system by requesting WADA to convene an “Extraordinary World Conference on Doping” in 2017. The Olympic Summit on 8 October 2016 will propose further measures in this respect. This will include proposals to clarify and increase transparency of the respective responsibilities in the fight against doping; the accreditation and supervision procedures of WADA accredited laboratories; and the WADA “International Standards for Laboratories” (ISL).The IOC is reinforcing the request issued by the Olympic Summit on 17 October 2015 to make the entire anti-doping system independent from sports organisations.
Uber is facing a legal challenge from drivers who say that they should be recognised officially as workers at the company, as calls grow for new rights for the UK’s burgeoning army of self-employed individuals.

In a tribunal hearing described as “the case of the year in UK employment law”, lawyers working for a group of Uber drivers will argue that the terms and conditions of their work with the company mean that they are not technically self-employed and should be entitled to a range of benefits that they currently do not receive.



The case, which begins on Wednesday, underlines the growth of the so-called “gig economy”, where companies use self-employed workers rather than keeping people on their books. On Monday, the Guardian highlighted the case of Hermes, where the 10,500 couriers working for the parcel delivery company are self-employed. This perfectly legal arrangement means that they are not entitled to the “national living wage”, pension contributions, or holiday or sick pay.

In the case of Hermes, one employee told the Guardian that they had earned as little as £5.50 an hour over some periods, although the company said its network of couriers received the equivalent of £9.80 an hour on average. “We believe all Hermes couriers will receive parcel delivery and collection rates that will give them the ability to earn at a level that is at least equal to the national living wage,” the company said.

The case against Uber is being taken by 19 drivers, with two test cases starting on 20 July. The ride-hailing app has about 30,000 drivers in London, all of whom are designated as self-employed.

Annie Powell, a solicitor at law firm Leigh Day who will represent the drivers, said the case hinged on two things: the nature of Uber’s business and the control it had over drivers. “Uber is arguing that it is a technology company and that it does not provide a transport service to customers, it just puts them in touch with drivers,” she said.

Powell said the hearing would seek to prove that this was not the case, and that because drivers were subject to ratings and were not told where customers needed to be dropped off, they were not operating as self-employed businesses. “We are arguing that they are workers ... Workers have fewer rights than employees, but are entitled to the national minimum wage, holiday pay, the right not to be discriminated against and the right not to have deductions made from their salary,” she said.



Uber, which has its European headquarters in the Netherlands, was seeking to argue that drivers in the UK can only seek a remedy in the Dutch courts, Powell said.



If the drivers were successful, she said, other businesses might face similar claims. There was a “creeping erosion of employment rights as companies misclassify their workers as self-employed”, Powell said, adding that new technology was making it easier for companies to have more remote relationships with workers. “This has changed how work looks and might give rise to the argument that people are not employees.”



Jo Bertram, the regional general manager for Uber UK, said more than 30,000 drivers in London used the app “and this case only involves a very small number”.

“The main reason people choose to partner with Uber is so they can become their own boss, pick their own hours and work completely flexibly. Many partner-drivers have left other lines of work and chosen to partner with Uber for this very reason.”

Sean Nesbitt, a partner in the employment team at law firm Taylor Wessing, said the scheduled five-day hearing was “the case of the year in UK employment law” for three reasons.

“First, Uber is battling a wave of litigation around the world. A US class action settlement worth $84m-$100m (£64m-£76m) is having trouble getting judicial approval, with criticism that it is too cheap a price. The UK case will further fuel litigation in other industries, and other countries,” he said.

Nesbitt said the UK had a useful “third way between costly employee status and low rights self-employment status”. The label of “worker” gives basic protections on working time and pay, and includes the right to litigate, which Uber tries to avoid with arbitration clauses.

Thirdly, he said, the case, which is being supported by the GMB union, highlighted the opportunities for unions to regroup and represent workers in the gig economy.

Similar cases due to begin from later this year will see four cycle couriers taking separate tribunal cases against Excel, City Sprint, Addison Lee and eCourier, arguing that they are not truly self-employed, as the companies currently describe them. They work up to 50 hours a week for a single companies, receiving £2 or £3 for each parcel that they deliver. The first case will be heard in November and the other three will follow at the start of 2017.

“The real battleground is the extent to which they are really in business on their own account,” said the couriers’ barrister, Jason Galbraith-Marten. “The law says that if you are an employee, you have to deliver a personal service; you have to turn up and do the work yourself. If you’re running a business, you can send someone else ... The idea that a courier would have other people to send is fanciful.”

Galbraith-Marten said the cases would explore whether the companies were obliged to provide the couriers with work and whether they could work for someone else at the same time – the couriers will argue that they are not able to do deliveries for more than one company.

In one case, he said, the company had argued that a courier had been able to take time off, proving that he was not obliged to work, but it had emerged that this was the result of an accident, which meant that he could not ride his bike. During that time, he was not entitled to sick pay from the company.

While the hearings were measuring individual cases against existing law, if the couriers and the Uber drivers were successful, the rules around employment law may have to evolve, he said. “As more and more of these cases come to the fore, it has a cumulative effect in terms of changing people’s attitude to the nature of employment,” Galbraith-Marten said. “We may well want things, including services, to be cheap, but how is this funded? Does it come out of the companies’ profits or from having people on these types of contracts where it’s the couriers who are suffering to keep the service cheap?”
Twitter is opening the blue checkmark to everyone. Starting today, the company will let users request a verified account on its website by filling out a form with a verified phone number and email address, a profile photo, and additional information regarding why verification is required or helpful. In defining who will get approved, Twitter still says "an account may be verified if it is determined to be of public interest." Prior to today, Twitter tended only to verify public figures, brands, and people in media, politics, sports, business, and other high-profile sectors.

"We want to make it even easier for people to find creators and influencers on Twitter so it makes sense for us to let people apply for verification," said Tina Bhatnagar, Twitter's vice president of user services, in a statement. "We hope opening up this application process results in more people finding great, high-quality accounts to follow, and for these creators and influencers to connect with a broader audience."

Twitter favors real names and accurate profile photos when deciding who gets verified

It's unclear why Twitter is opening the process to the public. The company says it has about 187,000 verified accounts, but around 310 million monthly active users. The disparity there, alongside increased pressure to provide anti-harassment tools, means more and more users may only be interacting with those who share their verification status. For instance, Twitter lets verified users filter their notifications to only show replies, mentions, or likes by other verified users. (The new Engage app offers some of those features to regular users as well.)

This is by design, as Twitter's harassment problem as grown so bad that certain subsets of high-profile users on the platform have chosen not to subject themselves to the random attacks of strangers. Just yesterday, comedian and Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones was subjected to an extreme amount of racist remarks and hate speech from largely anonymous users, pushing her to call for better stronger Twitter guidelines. "We rely on people to report this type of behavior to us but we are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to prevent this kind of abuse," a Twitter spokesperson told BuzzFeed in response to Jones' comments. "We realize we still have a lot of work in front of us before Twitter is where it should be on how we handle these issues."

One of the worst errors Twitter made was making a few anti-abuse features only available to verified users; that seems to be changing. — Anil Dash (@anildash) July 19, 2016

For those worried about rampant harassers gaining the blue checkmark, the system in place does not appear to undermine anti-harassment measures. Twitter's support page says it favors people who use their real name or recognizable stage name, as well as a profile or header photo that accurately represents the person. You can also provide URLs to support the request, and Twitter reserves the right to demand an uploaded scan of a government-issued ID.

Twitter may still only verify public figures

It's still unclear if Twitter plans to verify everyday people who fill out the form, or stick with its previous practice of only granting it to public figures and industry users, like journalists. If a critical mass of users do opt for verification — and ultimately use their real name and photos — it could spell the end of the egg avatar, or at the very least could drastically reduce the visibility of anonymous users.

Although anonymity has been a hallmark feature of Twitter since its launch, the vitriolic nature of the user base has forced the company to make hard choices about its commitment to the philosophy. Still, many critics of Twitter's policies say it still has not done enough. This change could be an opportunity for the company to present a choice to a majority of its users: shape up, or be left behind.

Germany’s transport minister is proposing new legislation that would put a number of new requirements on automakers as they roll out autonomous vehicles, according to Reuters.

The proposal is from German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt and it would require that drivers remain seated in front of the steering wheel so they would be able to intervene in an emergency. They wouldn’t be expected to pay attention to traffic, but the fact that the legislation would require the existence of a steering wheel at all may draw criticism from companies working on autonomous vehicles.

Similar proposed rules in California were heavily criticized by a number of companies, including Google. Carmakers pleaded with US regulators earlier this year for limited regulation on autonomous cars to encourage rapid development of potentially lifesaving technologies.

Also included in the proposed German regulations is a requirement for automakers to include a black box in autonomous vehicles to help determine responsibility in the event of a crash. Given that many cars — we’ve seen this from Tesla in particular — already have these sorts of systems, this should be one of the less-controversial items from an automaker perspective, though privacy advocates may raise concerns.

The Verge has reached out to a number of automakers for comment on the proposed regulations.

The FBI investigated the Orlando shooter for 10 months beginning in 2013, putting him under surveillance, recording his calls and using confidential informants to gauge whether he had been radicalized after the suspect talked at work about his connections with al-Qaeda and dying as a martyr.

As part of the investigation, Omar Mateen, who was killed in a shootout with police on Sunday morning, was placed on a terrorism watch list and interviewed twice before the probe was closed in March 2014 because agents concluded he was not a threat, FBI Director James B. Comey said Monday in an interview with reporters at bureau headquarters.

Several months later, in July 2014, Mateen surfaced in another investigation into the first American to die as a suicide bomber in Syria, a fellow Floridian. And, again, investigators moved on.

It was the third time — following the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and a planned attack last year on a contest to draw the prophet Muhammad — that someone who had been scrutinized by the FBI later carried out a terrorist attack.

Comey said the bureau was reexamining its contact with Mateen as new details emerged from law enforcement officials about the deadliest shooting rampage in U.S. history — a massacre that left 49 people dead and dozens of others wounded at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

“We are also going to look hard at our own work to see whether there is something we should have done differently,” Comey said. “So far, the honest answer is: I don’t think so.”

Comey said that during the three-hour standoff the gunman had with Orlando police officers, there were three different ­911-related calls with him. The gunman called 911 at about 2:30 a.m., about half an hour after opening fire, and then hung up the phone. Mateen then called a second time and spoke briefly to a dispatcher before hanging up again, and then the dispatcher called him back and they spoke briefly.

“During the calls, he said he was doing this for the leader of ISIL, who he named and pledged loyalty to,” said Comey, using an acronym for the group known as the Islamic State.

However, Comey said there were no signs that Mateen was directly tied to any kind of network, and he added that it remained unclear exactly which extremist group he supported. In addition to pledging allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, Comey noted, Mateen referred to a link to its bitter rival, al-Qaeda — an American’s suicide bombing in Syria. He also expressed solidarity with the Boston Marathon bombers.

President Obama said Monday that the gunman appeared to be motivated by extremist propaganda online, while saying that investigators delving into the attacker’s background have not found any communication linking him with radical groups.

“We see no clear evidence that he was directed externally,” Obama said during remarks in the Oval Office. “It does appear that at the last minute, he announced allegiance to ISIL. But there is no evidence so far that he was in fact directed by ISIL, and at this stage there’s no direct evidence that he was part of a larger plot.”

Obama said that the shooting appeared so far to be a case of “homegrown extremism.”

As terrorism again surged to the forefront of the country’s political debate, the presumptive nominees for the two major parties, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, shifted plans for events Monday to focus their remarks on national security.

Clinton, speaking in Cleveland, warned that the threat posed by the Islamic State is “metastasizing” and vowed to make “targeting lone wolves a top priority” if elected.

She also said that someone who has been watched by the FBI “shouldn’t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.”

“It’s essential that we stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out attacks,” she said. “I believe weapons of war have no place on our streets.”

Mateen carried a semiautomatic assault rifle and a handgun; a third gun was later found in his car, officials said.

[The history of the AR-15, the weapon used in the worst mass shootings]

Trump made television appearances Monday to reject calls for more gun control and repeatedly accuse Obama of being somehow sympathetic with radicalized Muslims.

“We’re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he’s got something else in mind,” Trump said.

In a speech in New Hampshire, he called for a ban on immigrants from Middle Eastern countries Monday but notably did not make explicit reference to a religious test on Muslims, which he has mentioned in the past. He said that strengthening the effectiveness of immigration screenings is a key component to preventing domestic terrorism.

Law enforcement officials in Florida, meanwhile, offered a new accounting of the shootout. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said that police first encountered Mateen shortly after the initial gunfire at about 2 a.m., when an off-duty officer working at the club exchanged shots with Mateen.

Additional officers called to the scene soon joined in another gun battle, at which point Mateen retreated farther into the building and, eventually, into a bathroom. The police then held back because there were no more gunshots, Mina said, and they tried to negotiate with Mateen to avoid any more bloodshed.

Mateen had been in a bathroom with four or five people, while an additional 15 or 20 were in another bathroom, Mina said. During these negotiations, Mateen was “cool and calm” and did not make many demands, Mina said.

After about three hours, police said they decided to storm the building after the shooter mentioned bomb belts or explosives. Mina said the police used explosives and then an armored Bearcat to break a hole in the club’s wall. Hostages poured out, and Mateen — armed with a pair of guns — came out as well.

During the gun battle, Mateen was killed and one Orlando police officer was injured when a bullet struck his Kevlar helmet.

However, much remains unclear, including whether any hostages were injured or killed by crossfire.

In a news conference Monday, Mina said storming the building “was the right decision to make” because police thought other lives might be in danger.

Authorities say they are continuing to explore whether other people may be connected to the case. The investigation into Mateen has expanded to look at other people and stretches from Florida to Kabul. Mateen’s family is originally from Afghanistan.

Comey said Mateen, who worked as a contract security guard at a local courthouse, claimed in 2013 to co-workers that he had family connections to ­al-Qaeda and was a member of Hezbollah, two opposing terrorist groups that have clashed repeatedly in Syria.

The FBI director called the comments “inflammatory and contradictory.”

Comey said Mateen also told colleagues that he had mutual acquaintances with the Tsarnaev brothers, who were responsible for the Boston bombing. He spoke of a martyr’s death. Co-workers brought his claims to the attention of the local sheriff’s department, which passed them along to the FBI.

The FBI opened what is known as a preliminary investigation — one of hundreds that the bureau handles at any one time and that typically last six months. Comey said the investigation was extended once with the approval of an FBI supervisor at the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Miami.

When interviewed by the FBI, Mateen claimed he made the statements in anger because his co-workers were teasing him about being a Muslim and he felt discriminated against.

“The evidence developed during the investigation was consistent with his explanation that he had said these things to try to freak out his co-workers,” Comey said.

The investigation was closed.

“As I would hope the American people would want, we don’t keep people under investigation indefinitely,” Comey said. “If . . . we don’t see predication for continuing it, then we close it.”

During the period of the investigation, Mateen was placed in a terrorism database, but Comey declined to say whether the bureau also put him on the no-fly list.

The FBI also learned that he had traveled to Saudi Arabia in March 2011 to make a pilgrimage and again in March 2012. Comey said the Saudis assisted the FBI investigation but didn’t turn up anything.

Mateen’s name next surfaced as part of the investigation into Moner Mohammad Abusalha, believed to be the first American to launch a suicide bombing in Syria. Abusalha prayed at the same Fort Pierce, Fla., mosque that Mateen attended, friends and authorities said.

A witness told the FBI he had become concerned about Mateen, who had been watching videos of a radical cleric, Anwar ­al-Awlaki, a top leader and propagandist in al-Qaeda’s branch in Yemen. Awlaki’s rhetoric has been implicated in numerous terrorist attacks, including the 2009 Fort Hood shooting in which 13 people were killed by Army Maj. Nidal Hasan.

But the witness stopped worrying when Mateen started a relationship, had a child and found steady employment as a security guard.

The FBI questioned Mateen again but found no reason to reopen an investigation.

Comey said the FBI had found nothing in Mateen’s past that would have legally blocked him from purchasing a gun.

Mateen purchased two weapons from the St. Lucie Shooting Center, shop owner Ed Henson said at a news conference Monday.

“An evil person came in here and legally purchased two firearms from us,” Henson said, adding that Mateen had multiple security licenses and passed a full background check before he was allowed to buy the guns.

Henson said that if Mateen hadn’t bought the guns at his shop, he would have been able to buy them somewhere else.

“We happened to be the gun store he picked. It’s horrible,” said Henson, who spent two decades with the New York Police Department before retiring in 2002. “I’m sorry he picked my place. I wish he’d picked nowhere.”

A Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) fighter walks in the silos and mills of Manbij after the SDF took control of it, in Aleppo Governorate, Syria, July 1, 2016.

WASHINGTON U.S.-backed rebels fighting Islamic State militants in Syria captured a headquarters operation as they pushed into the western part of the town of Manbij over the weekend, the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday.

The Islamic State headquarters, which was located in a hospital, was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town, enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting, the statement said.

The Syrian rebels were continuing to battle Islamic State on four fronts for control of Manbij, clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city, the statement said.

Islamic State militants have staged counterattacks, but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition, the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began.

Gannett has been trying to swallow whole the company formerly known as Tribune Publishing, while continuing to buy up newspapers around the country. In April it concluded its acquisition of Journal Media Group — which included the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel — adding another 15 dailies to its collection. Most recently this month, it bought the North Jersey Media Group, adding papers like the Bergen County Record, bringing its tally of dailies owned to 109, including its national presence, USA Today.

“Our CEO Bob Dickey has been pretty transparent about the fact that he wants to grow our footprint,” Joanne Lipman, Gannett’s chief content officer, said when I asked her about the company’s ambitions (and hopes and dreams, for new technologies and new reporting collaborations). Lipman, former deputy managing editor of The Wall Street Journal and founder of the short-lived Condé Nast Portfolio, joined Gannett eight months ago to oversee the USA Today network, not long after Gannett split off its broadcast assets into a separate company called Tegna (sorry, “TEGNA”) and rebranded its constellation of local news organizations as part of the “USA TODAY Network.”

The Gannett’s vision for the network is becoming increasingly clear. The larger papers in the network can draw wholesale from USA Today news and entertainment sections, and USA Today can conduct nationwide investigations, bolstered by boots-on-the-ground local reporting from its many local outlets. A year-long investigation into the broken system of tracking teacher misconduct was the first USA Today network project to run in print and online in every publication within the network. A virtual reality news show, coming this fall, will pull in local stories. Gannett’s properties now also use a single CMS, and the company is currently building out a “unified budgeting and communication system,” Lipman told me (“to make it easier for our properties to grab an article, photograph, or video from the network than it is for them to grab something from the AP”).

Our full conversation, slightly edited for length and clarity, is below.

Shan Wang: Can you start by telling me a little more about your day-to-day, or week-to-week even, and about your mandate and priorities at Gannett and with the USA Today network?

Joanne Lipman: I’m the chief content officer and I’m also the editor-in-chief of the USA Today network. I started in January to lead the USA Today network, to actually turn it into a network — from a siloed network to a connected organization. I’m the chief content officer and I’m also the editor-in-chief of the USA Today network. I started in January to lead the USA Today network, to actually turn it into a network — from a siloed network to a connected organization. Now, whether you’re at USA Today or whether you’re in Jackson, Mississippi, and you come up with a great idea as a reporter, we can execute it. It’s really exciting.The transformation from individual publications to working together as a network has gone much faster than I would’ve expected. The first example of that came out in February. For the teachers’ investigation: we have a data investigation team and they were able to collect data from all 50 states, looking at teachers who had been fired for sexual abuse, physical abuse, who were able to get jobs in other states because of a really broken background check system. There was a big national story that ran in USA Today. A lot of the examples that were in the story came from our local properties — our journalists went out and did their reporting in local markets. Because we were able to distribute this incredible dataset to all of our local properties, they localized and customized the articles that they ran. That investigation was the first in the USA Today network that ran in print and online in every one of our publications. A national investigation grew out of it, and a number of statewide investigations. There were quite a few teachers who were removed from classrooms who, it turns out, were sexual predators. In the wake of Flint, we wondered how many other communities have toxic levels of lead in the water. We found there were 2,000 communities in all 50 states that had toxic levels of lead in their drinking water, which is astonishing. Again, this was a huge national story, but many of our properties were able to customize the data for their own local markets. You’ve seen this model most recently in the Trump and the law series. It grew out of a very simple question I’d asked our investigative and political team back in February: Every news organization describes Donald Trump as litigious. How litigious is he? How many lawsuits has he been involved in, on either side? That grew into an interactive database online. A large portion of those lawsuits were for nonpayment to very small businesses — people like painters, carpenters, plumbers. The fact that we have the entire network is absolutely key to us being able to do this kind of work, which we weren’t able to do previously.

Wang: What direction do the story ideas flow in these USA Today network projects? It sounds like in that Trump example, that was your own idea. Do these projects come top-down, and local properties are asked to look into the story from their local angles? How does the collaboration actually work — do reporters meet with other USA Today reporters in their geographic area?

Lipman: A really important part of the network is empowering journalists in any newsroom to come up with an idea. The toxic water series was co-led by an investigative editor at the Arizona Republic, working with an investigative editor at USA Today, and working with the properties across the network. A really important part of the network is empowering journalists in any newsroom to come up with an idea. The toxic water series was co-led by an investigative editor at the Arizona Republic, working with an investigative editor at USA Today, and working with the properties across the network. I talk about this a lot with our properties. We can support them on any idea that they might have. There’s something going on right now. We have a reporter in Jackson, Mississippi, which is There’s something going on right now. We have a reporter in Jackson, Mississippi, which is one of our smaller properties . He had a great idea — we can’t tell you about it because it hasn’t been published yet — for something that would include a documentary series. Because it’s a smaller newsroom, they don’t have those assets in-house. We have a terrific VP of community news, Randy Lovely , who’s been with us for many years. He called around to a variety of publications around the network. The Des Moines Register said they had an editor they could lend to the project. USA Today had a great videographer. Suddenly, you have a project team based out of Mississippi working on a project that we’re able to support through the network’s other publications.

Wang: The Arizona Republic or the Des Moines Register or other papers you called out earlier are still relatively large presences in bigger cities. For a tiny paper, if they don’t have a data journalist, for instance, or someone who’s able to spare some time working with the data, what resources do they get from the network specifically to help “customize” those network-wide national projects you highlighted?

Lipman: We have data reporters in various newsrooms who can work collaboratively together. We have a reporter who specializes in taxation based in our Westchester publication, for example. You find people across the network who have expertise. That's it? @USATODAY has 126 stories across the network – https://t.co/e1ZKUDulN1 pic.twitter.com/h7GuhMaWLI — Nick Penzenstadler (@npenzenstadler) July 13, 2016 We have data reporters in various newsrooms who can work collaboratively together. We have a reporter who specializes in taxation based in our Westchester publication, for example. You find people across the network who have expertise. It wouldn’t generally be that I’m in one market, and I call the market in the next state over and say, hey, can you send me a photographer? But it could be! That could happen. There’s pretty much nothing we can’t do. We can move the resources around to help. If we have a lengthy investigation, and it’s got import for all markets, and you’re a journalist in a very small newsroom, you can have all our data to do your own reporting around it. Or, we also do a couple of different sizes of the article. USA Today might run the full-length piece, and then there might be shorter articles for some of the smaller publications. Sometimes we’ll do several different cuts of a piece so different publications have the ability to run it online and in print in different formats, because we’ve got some very large metro papers and some much smaller sites. A reporter at one of our smaller properties in Florida came up with a really fun sports idea and realized that pretty much every local market had a similar thing going on. He and his editor sent a note to me. We put together a small team of people — editors from a couple of our publications — to talk through the idea. It’s grown into something that you will see in the next month or so. It starts at the local level and ladders up to USA Today. This isn’t top-down. It isn’t: “USA Today comes up with an idea and imposes it on the rest of the world.” Any one of our 4,000 reporters can come up with an idea and if it scales across the network, we will help them scale it. RELATED ARTICLE The game of concentration: The Internet is pushing the American news business to New York and the coasts The network turned out to be a real benefit in this political season. We are in red states, blue states, giant cities, suburban areas, rural areas, and small towns. We’re doing a project for both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and it’ll appear on the first day of the convention. We’ve done a really deep dive on who the voters are across the country. The project takes advantage of that sweep of the network and our understanding of local communities. Nieman Lab had a piece on the concentration of journalism jobs on the coasts (New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles). [From that story: “When The Washington Post looked at Bureau of Labor Statistics data last year, it found that the share of American reporting jobs that were in New York, Washington, and Los Angeles went from 1 in 8 in 2004 to 1 in 5 in 2014.”] We saw that and were interested to see how we stacked up. We crunched our own numbers. For us, it’s one in 39. The vast majority of our journalists are not in the big cities. They’re boots on the ground. They see the country in a way other journalists cannot. The key to our network is having strong community news organizations. After most elections we look to see who our papers have endorsed, and it’s split pretty evenly between red states and blue states for endorsements. The Orlando shooting is another example of the network’s potential. In the past, USA Today would’ve put 20 people on an airplane down to Florida to make sure they covered every aspect of the Orlando shooting. We now have publications throughout Florida. They did the coverage and their coverage was spectacular. In the first 24 hours after the shooting, we had something like 100 pieces of journalism, all of it gathered on the USA Today site. All our local Florida publications also coordinated to cover the tragic events. The rest of the network could pick up whatever pieces were relevant to their markets, whatever they had room for in their publications.

Wang: So there are specific circles of collaboration, too, state by state? I saw in So there are specific circles of collaboration, too, state by state? I saw in Wisconsin there’s a sort of investigative reporting consortium . Are there other new collaborations you’re trying to push?

Lipman: In Wisconsin we have about 10 properties that are mostly smaller community news organizations. We have a single editor who oversees the coverage. We have the property in Green Bay, which really knows football. Every property in Wisconsin is interested in football coverage. Everybody. They cover the statehouse. All the properties are interested in that. In Wisconsin we have about 10 properties that are mostly smaller community news organizations. We have a single editor who oversees the coverage.

I actually went out and visited them and asked them to tell me what worked and didn’t work, what lessons they’ve learned. They’re a microcosm of what we’re doing network-wide.

Wang: And what are those lessons?

Lipman: When I came in to USA Today, I had three major priorities. One, strengthening the network. Two, focusing on innovation — video, social, mobile, virtual reality. Three, making sure we had the organization and communication systems in place to make all this work together. When I came in to USA Today, I had three major priorities.

Three, making sure we had the organization and communication systems in place to make all this work together. On priority one, we are well ahead of what my expectations were. For that I give all credit to journalists who are here. There’s a culture of collaboration. For journalists in other markets, to see their work appear on USA Today and appear on publications around America is satisfying. RELATED ARTICLE Sure, people like online video, but that doesn’t mean they want to watch your hard news videos For priority number two, we really want to increase our video views. We had close to a billion last year. We’re on a sharp upward curve in terms of Facebook and Twitter engagement, and we have a new network head of social media. Mobile is important. The vast majority of our audience is reaching us on a mobile device. That’s making us rethink how we present our articles, and video in particular: We know people are watching video on their phones with the sound turned off. Virtual reality is something we’re really excited about. Our show Vrtually There is going to launch in the fall. Our chief revenue officer took a pilot to Cannes. That is a major push for us. We think of ourselves as a digital news organization overall. We still print papers, but our audience is increasingly digital and mobile. When I talked about that 100 million-plus in our audience, we have more millennials than Vice or Vox. We have more C-suiters than The Wall Street Journal in our audience. We think very purposefully about how we interact with those audiences. RELATED ARTICLE Working together: How NBC built a new tool to improve collaboration across its newsrooms Third priority: Communication and organization are things we’re working on very aggressively. Because this company had been siloed before, our individual publications weren’t connected . We’re now all on the same CMS. But we’re not on a common communication system. For us to work as a network, right now, there are a lot of workarounds. Emails. Phone calls. There are a lot of separate Slack channels. I brought in Jim Pensiero, who was at The Wall Street Journal with me. He helped connect all the Journal’s various organizations. He was the liaison for the tech side. He’s helping us do that. Our hope is that by the end of the calendar year, we’ll have a much smoother content budgeting and communication system that will make it more seamless for us to work together. We’re building it ourselves.

Wang: We’ve so far talked mostly about sharing editorial resources. What about these technological resources? I’m imagining when the virtual reality news show launches and needs to frequently pull in local content, some of the tiniest newsrooms don’t have any VR capabilities and won’t be able to keep up.

Lipman: That’s not true. In the fall, we distributed 50 or 60 virtual reality cameras and trained up people from the local markets. That’s not true. In the fall, we distributed 50 or 60 virtual reality cameras and trained up people from the local markets. Everybody in the industry that’s working in virtual reality, it’s still new to them. But we’ve got equipment out there. We had a virtual reality summit back in January or February, where we brought in videographers and photographers from around the network, gave them equipment, and spent a couple of days working with them on how to use it. I have a content lead on my team who’s based in Phoenix. Until recently she was an editor at the Arizona Republic. I hired her onto my chief content officer team, heading up innovation. I’ve always worked for large national news organizations. What I realized coming here is that the talent is spread out throughout the country. When I put together my team, I thought I’d have to go external to hire top roles. But our head of social media came over from the sports group. Our head of data analytics came from Michigan, where we have the Free Press. Our head of operations, Mizell Stewart, was running Journal Media Group out in the midwest. They live outside the media bubble.

Wang: Tell me about the blind spots, geographic and technological, that you guys currently are facing and want to expand into.

Lipman: Sure, if you look at a map, you’ll see some blank spots, and if you look at Tribune Company, you’ll see they’ll fill in some blank spots. Sure, if you look at a map, you’ll see some blank spots, and if you look at Tribune Company, you’ll see they’ll fill in some blank spots. [We both laugh awkwardly at this.] We have some geographic areas we don’t cover. Our CEO Bob Dickey has been pretty transparent about the fact that he wants to grow our footprint. But part of it is, if you think about it, one of the things we’re doing with the network is, we want to make it easier for our properties to grab an article, photograph, or video from the network than it is for them to grab something from the AP. We’ve already been able to reduce our reliance on AP, because we have so much local content. Technology itself is changing so quickly. Before I got here, three or four years ago, we redid the website. But it’s time for us to look at that again. Three years — that’s an eternity in technology time frame. We’ve already been working on redoing the app. USA Today and a number of local markets now are testing the app. On the app, you can choose up to three local markets. I’m in Virginia, but I grew up in New Jersey, and the hometown paper happens to be a Gannett paper. On my USA Today app, I get my USA Today news, and below that, stories from East Brunswick, so I can keep up with my hometown. You’re going to be able to watch virtual reality on the app. We’re pushing ahead, but technology moves so quickly. Technology is a challenge for every media organization. Then the piece I was talking about, with the communications and budgeting tool, that’s a technological advancement for us also.

Wang: So the goal hypothetically is for the USA Today network to be in every single city? I could go into the app and be able to select from literally every city or town where there could feasibly be a news outlet? What is the scope of the ambition?

Lipman: I’ll answer that this way. At a time when the media industry is so under pressure, the network’s allowed us to think about a new way to use the reporting strength we already have. I’ll answer that this way. At a time when the media industry is so under pressure, the network’s allowed us to think about a new way to use the reporting strength we already have. The ambition is to be able to cover the country and the world in a comprehensive way and to have the best journalism out there. To be known for investigative work. We just hired a head of investigative, to work on improving the quality of the investigative journalism that we do. All media companies are looking for the right model. The model that we’ve created here is a very compelling one. It gives us scale. We’d like to be the primary and best news source for people, and this strategy feels right. We’re just scratching the surface of where we can go from here.
Travelling around India can be daunting.

Packing Mumbai, Delhi, Agra – not to mention the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan – into a week is verging on the impossible, but that’s what the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did earlier this year, and I followed them every step of the way.

While challenging, it was the perfect chance to experience a bite-sized portion of this part of the world.

I have always longed to experience the cosmopolitan charm of Mumbai, shop in New Delhi’s markets and marvel at the splendour of the Taj Mahal.

Luckily for me, the Duke and Duchess, who were on an official overseas tour, had a similar checklist.

Monument of love: The Duke and Duchess sit in front of the Taj Mahal during their Royal tour earlier this year

The Cambridges’ first stop was Mumbai, India’s commercial centre.

After arriving refreshed from their overnight flight (they flew direct from London First Class on British Airways), the couple headed to the Taj Mahal Palace, one of the most iconic hotels in the world.

Famous for its architecture and its clientele, which include presidents and princes, the hotel was attacked by terrorists in 2008 – 172 people were killed.

A memorial, where the Royal couple laid a wreath, serves as a reminder of the tragedy. Security now is understandably tight, with airport-style body-scanners and bag checks.

While the top suite at the Taj costs more than £10,000 a night, tea for two in the Sea Lounge is a far more affordable £22, and you still get to experience the hotel’s recently restored art museum, boasting more than 4,000 works.

The top suite at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel (pictured) costs more than £10,000 a night but tea for two in the Sea Lounge is a far more affordable £22

You can also clearly see the Gateway of India, the city’s most famous landmark. Work on the dramatic stone arch overlooking the busy harbour started in 1911 to commemorate the post-Coronation visit of William’s great-great grandfather, George V.

It is free to visit and tourists and locals alike enjoy admiring the great monument with its striking Gujarati motifs.

It’s also worth a trip to see the caves at Elephanta Island – ferries (£1.50 return) run every 30 minutes. The caves are home to Shiva temples, with carvings and spectacular religious rock sculptures dating back to the 5th Century.

Bombay, as it was originally called, started as a port, and fishing is still an important trade. When you’re back on land, take a taxi to Cuffe Parade to see the Koli villagers who fish in colourful boats.

Despite India’s burgeoning economy, 60 per cent of the city’s 20 million inhabitants still live in poverty. William and Kate visited the Banganga slum in the Malabar Hill area portrayed in Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire.

Perched majestically in the Himalayas, the Kingdom of Bhutan is often voted one of the world’s top destinations. Above, the Tiger's Nest Monastery

Here, 10,000 people live in dilapidated shacks next to some of Mumbai’s wealthiest properties. Nothing prepares you for the shocking disparity.

Slum dwellers sell everything from scrap metal to flower garlands. Open-air ‘launderettes’ – bathtubs full of bleachy water – do a roaring trade and sheets hanging out in the stinking alleyways typify the area.

Tour operators can arrange trips into Dharavi, the city’s biggest slum. It’s a sobering experience.

With little time for shopping in Mumbai, I decided to hit the famous markets of Delhi instead.

The capital was baking hot and always busy. I stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel, a great base to explore the city.

Dilli Haat Market in South Delhi is a taxi ride away and entrance is 60 rupees (about 67p) for foreigners. The street market is an Aladdin’s cave of stalls selling clothes, jewellery, handbags, shoes, wooden crafts and handicrafts, but be prepared to haggle.

I bought a pair of beaded ballet pumps for 400 rupees (£4.50) after initially being offered them for 800 rupees.

If you can handle the heat and the crowds, Sarojini Nagar open-air market is a bargain-hunter’s paradise.

William and Kate also visited Gandhi Smriti, the house where Mahatma Gandhi lived for two years before he was assassinated in 1948. The gardens are beautiful and you can see the very spot where the ‘Father of the Nation’ was killed.

After the searing heat of the day, it’s a relief to go out and see many of the capital’s famous sights by night. India Gate and the Lotus Temple, one of the country’s most important temples, are spectacularly lit up after dusk, while the Red Fort is simply stunning at sunset.

Taking aim: Kate tries her hand at archery in Thimpu, Bhutan. Archery is Bhutan’s national sport and is taken very seriously

Keen not to get the dreaded ‘Delhi belly’, I dined at Saravana Bhavan, a well-known vegetarian chain, and enjoyed curd vadai (sweet dumpling in coconut milk) and uttapam and dosa pancakes, which were divine.

Next stop was the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, which meant an early morning flight to the north-eastern city of Guwahati. The only way to reach the park from the city is via a terrifying five-hour drive.

The Iora Retreat in the heart of the park offers accommodation from £60 a night, and staff can arrange tours by the Assam Safari Organisation. Like William and Kate, I booked a 6am tour for 2,700 rupees (just under £30).

Spread across 300,000 square miles, the bush is expansive and packed with wildlife.

The park is home to elephants, water buffalo, swamp deer, tigers, and two-thirds of the world’s population of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses. It’s incredibly rare to see a tiger, but on most visits you see just about everything else and you can ride elephants at the park’s entrance.

Rare: A tiger in the Kaziranga National Park. The park is home to elephants, water buffalo, swamp deer, tigers, and two-thirds of the world’s population of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses

The only inconvenience is getting back to Guwahati, essential for onward travel, including to Agra to see the Taj Mahal.

William and Kate wanted to visit the great monument to love before leaving India and so did I, even if the heat was unbearable.

The Taj Mahal is a wonder to behold. The crowds, rather like ants against the vast mausoleum, were cordoned off during the Royal couple’s visit, giving me the rare chance to get a clear picture.

Even on a whistlestop week-long tour like that undertaken by the Cambridges, if you are travelling to India it’s worth finding time to visit Bhutan too.

Perched majestically in the Himalayas, the kingdom is often voted one of the world’s top destinations. With a population of under a million, it was opened up to tourists only in 1974.

Today tourism is the government’s top priority and holidays are booked through one of the government’s licensed tour operators. Flights into Paro airport are an experience in itself as you fly over Mount Everest. The landing is also pretty spectacular.

There are excellent hotels in Bhutan, such as The Druk Hotel in the capital Thimphu, and getting around is easy. The national language is Dzongkha, but English is widely spoken.

With rolling hills, flowing streams and lush, green forests, the countryside is breathtaking and Bhutan has some of the best hiking areas in the world. William and Kate walked to the Taktsang (Tiger’s Nest) Monastery.

Archery is Bhutan’s national sport and is taken very seriously. However, stray arrows kill on average three people a year – so watch out!

In two days you can see plenty, but there is so much more to explore. William and Kate said they can’t wait to go back, and neither can I.

Bhutan has to be one of the most magical places on Earth.
Leaders of governments with nuclear arsenals typically avoid saying they'll press the Armageddon button.

Then there's Theresa May, Great Britain's new prime minister. There's been a long-standing debate in her country over the value of the UK's submarine-based nuclear-weapons program. So it was inevitable that May, during a parliamentary debate this week, would be asked about it. The Conservative Party leader was ready with a blunt and unequivocal reply.

"Are you prepared to authorize a nuclear strike that could kill hundreds of thousands of men, women and children?" Scottish National Party MP George Kerevan asked.

May's response: "Yes."

For the most part, the forceful answer is going over well in Britain. Here's The Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson:

There was no "Only under the most extreme circumstances with my eyes shut if a chap with gold braid on his shoulders tells me to press the button." Just YES. It was her first big test in the Commons and, in its way, it was as steely a statement of intent as Margaret Thatcher's [1990 anti-EU declaration] "No, No, NO."

OK, so perhaps the PM has been practicing her "resolute work leader" look in the bathroom mirror at Number 10 while [husband] Philip's still in his jim-jams wrestling with the Teasmade, but, goodness, it worked. It's only a week since Theresa Mary May became the country's second female Prime Minister and already things feel different with a woman at the helm.

Such straightforward talk about using nukes, without hemming and hawing or philosophizing about the morality of it, has long been considered taboo for anyone who wants to have a future in politics.

For years, Barry Goldwater served as a cautionary tale. In 1964, while running for U.S. president, he suggested NATO generals in the field should be allowed to use nuclear weapons without getting the president's approval. He also pointed out, in the midst of the Vietnam War, that low-yield atomic bombs would be a great way to defoliate Vietnam's forests and thus expose Vietcong supply lines from China.

His opponent in the general election, President Lyndon Johnson, played on fears of Goldwater's itchy nuclear trigger finger with the infamous "Daisy" ad. Johnson won the election in a landslide.

But that was back during the dark days of the Cold War, when nuclear decimation seemed like a very real possibility to the average citizen. Today, for the British, maintaining a nuclear-weapons option is chiefly symbolic.

May, pushing back against the argument that Britain should consider cheaper alternatives to the Trident-submarine nuclear-weapons program, insisted the country must maintain a credible "deterrent." "I am not prepared to settle for something that does not do the job," she said.

Labour Party critics of the program insist that May's pronouncements on nuclear weapons are little more than an attempt to turn "national security into a political game."

Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, in his memoirs, wrote that Trident's value is "non-existent in terms of military use." He said the best reason to keep it was "our status as a nation."

Authorities lifted a three-day publication ban in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, but newspapers delayed print runs Tuesday due to uncertainties about the restrictions imposed during massive anti-India protests that have left dozens of people dead and hundreds injured.

Newspapers owners and editors said the Kashmir government had yet to guarantee smooth media operations in the prevailing tense situation.

The government made a verbal apology and called the ban a "mistake," but then authorities "resorted to a propaganda blitzkrieg insisting that there was no ban," said Masood Hussain, a senior journalist and editor of the English weekly Kashmir Life, after the meeting with others in the local media industry. "It indicates that the government has not changed its press emergency."

He said the editors would review the situation Wednesday. "Government must own the ban and issue a statement guaranteeing that media operations are not being hampered from the movement of staff, to news gathering, printing and the distribution of the newspapers," Hussain said.

The state government's political adviser, Amitabh Mattoo, said the decision to temporarily ban newspaper publication was made without the knowledge of the state's top elected official, Mehbooba Mufti.

"Sometimes decisions taken at a local level is not something the highest authority approves of. There was some miscommunication," he said.

"We need to know who took the decision on the ban. We will take action once the crisis is over," he told New Delhi-based NDTV news channel late Monday.

Kashmir's largest street protests in years erupted more than a week ago after Indian troops killed the popular, young leader of the largest rebel group fighting against Indian rule in the disputed region. Violent clashes between rock-throwing Kashmiris and troops firing live ammunition, pellet guns and tear gas have persisted despite a strict curfew in place for an eleventh day Tuesday. Streets were mostly deserted otherwise, and with shops still closed, people were trying to cope with shortages of food and other necessities.

State government spokesman and Education Minister Nayeem Akhtar had said Friday the ban was aimed at "saving lives and strengthening peace efforts." Police raided newspaper offices, detained printing press workers and seized tens of thousands of local newspapers. The detained workers have since been freed.

In addition to the printing ban, cellular and internet services were absent and landline phone access limited throughout Kashmir, except in its main city of Srinagar, creating an information void.

Hussain, the journalist, told AP earlier that the communication and information blockade was powering rumors. "People want to know what's happening around and when we fail to provide news, rumor mill takes over. It doesn't help anyone," he said.

The latest fatality was reported Tuesday after a woman injured in Indian army firing overnight died in a hospital in Srinagar, a police officer said.

Two people, including a woman, were killed late Monday after soldiers fired at rock-throwing protesters in southern Qazigund area, said the officer speaking on a customary condition of anonymity.

The clashes have killed at least 46 people, mostly teens and young men, and a policeman since July 9. Nearly 2,000 civilians and about 1,600 government troops have been injured.

Separatist leaders have extended their strike call until Thursday afternoon followed by a shutdown and protests on Friday. The key leaders, Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik, in a statement late Monday said Indian leaders were "blinded by their own propaganda ... to the extent that (they're) unable to understand and accept the genuineness of people's anger and self-drive for freedom and justice."

Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim region, is divided between India and Pakistan, but both claim it in its entirety. Most people in Indian-held part resent the presence of hundreds of thousands of Indian troops and want independence or a merger with Pakistan.

Since 1989, more than 68,000 people have been killed in the uprising against Indian rule and the subsequent Indian military crackdown. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over control of Kashmir since British colonialists left the Indian subcontinent in 1947.

Google just paid for part of its acquisition of DeepMind in a surprising way.

The internet giant is using technology from the DeepMind artificial intelligence subsidiary for big savings on the power consumed by its data centers, according to DeepMind Co-Founder Demis Hassabis.

In recent months, the Alphabet Inc. unit put a DeepMind AI system in control of parts of its data centers to reduce power consumption by manipulating computer servers and related equipment like cooling systems. It uses a similar technique to DeepMind software that taught itself to play Atari video games, Hassabis said in an interview at a recent AI conference in New York.

The system cut power usage in the data centers by several percentage points, "which is a huge saving in terms of cost but, also, great for the environment," he said.

The savings translate into a 15 percent improvement in power usage efficiency, or PUE, Google said in a statement. PUE measures how much electricity Google uses for its computers, versus the supporting infrastructure like cooling systems.

Google said it used 4,402,836 MWh of electricity in 2014, equivalent to the average yearly consumption of about 366,903 U.S. family homes. A significant proportion of Google’s spending on electricity comes from its data centers, which support its globe-spanning web services and mobile apps.

Saving a few percentage points of electricity usage means major financial gains for Google. Typical electricity prices companies pay in the U.S. range from about $25 to $40 per MWh, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. (Prices in different regions range from a few dollars to more than $100). Either way, saving 10 percent on data center power consumption, for instance, could translate to hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for Google over multiple years. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for 400 million pounds, or more than $600 million at the time, according to The Guardian.

The application of DeepMind’s technology builds on previous efforts by Google to apply machine learning, a type of AI, to its data centers. Back in 2014, the company said it used neural networks, a type of pattern recognition system, to predict how its power usage would change over time, letting it arrange equipment in more efficient ways.

The DeepMind work goes a step further. Instead of making moves in an Atari game, the software changes how equipment runs inside the data centers to get the highest score -- in this case more efficient consumption of electricity.

"It controls about 120 variables in the data centers. The fans and the cooling systems and so on, and windows and other things," Hassabis said. "They were pretty astounded."

This is just the beginning of the project, Hassabis said. Now that DeepMind knows the approach works, it also knows where its AI system lacks information, so it may ask Google to put additional sensors into its data centers to let its software eke out even more efficiency.
Durban (CNN) A vaccine against HIV will be trialed in South Africa later this year after meeting the criteria needed to prove it could help fight the epidemic in Africa.

In 2015, 2.1 million new infections were reported -- two-thirds of which occurred in sub-Saharan Africa

A small trial, known as HVTN100 , took place in South Africa in 2015 to test the safety and strength of immunity the vaccine could provide, ahead of any larger-scale testing in affected populations.

Two-hundred and fifty-two healthy volunteers were enrolled to receive either the vaccine, known as ALVAC-HIV/gp120, or a placebo to compare the extent of immune response generated. The results were presented Tuesday at the 21st International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa.

"This was precautionary to see if the vaccine looks promising," said Linda Gail Bekker, deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, and president-elect of the International AIDS Society , who is leading the vaccine trials.

The vaccine stems from a landmark trial in Thailand in 2009 that was the first to show any protection against HIV, with 31% protection against the virus. This was enough to get experts in the field excited after years with no success.

"The obvious question is: Can we now replicate those results and can we improve upon them with greater breadth, depth and potency?" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease , whose organization sponsors the study.

The vaccine was improved for use in the higher-risk populations of sub-Saharan Africa, where a different subtype of the virus also exists.

"We've inserted specific inserts from viruses that have come off the subcontinent," said Gail Bekker. A new component was also introduced to stimulate stronger immunity, known as an adjuvant.

Four criteria were set as measures of its likely effectiveness, including the level of T-cell and antibody response to fight the virus if it were to infect.

"It gives the tick on all four, it does look promising and it should launch," Gail Bekker said. "We wanted to see a particular immune picture that would suggest that a big efficacy trial would be likely to yield results," she said.

"[This] was like the gatekeeper of will we or will we not go ahead," Fauci said, "and the answer is 'yes'."

A larger-scale trial of the vaccine will now begin in 5,400 people across four sites in South Africa in November 2016 and run for three years. A fifth dose of the vaccine will also be given in hope of longer-lasting protection.

The Thai study showed 60% protection against HIV after one year, but this fell to 31% by the end of the trial. The team hopes the new regimen will bring protection levels back up.

"We want to get it up to 60% and keep it there," Fauci said. "That's the reason for the boost and the reason for the adjuvant," he said.

Experts have long been awaiting a vaccine showing enough efficacy to dent the numbers of people newly infected with HIV each year, which fell by 0.7% between 2005 and 2015, according to a study published Tuesday and presented at the conference.

"We're hoping this can be the first licensable vaccine regimen in the world," said Gail Bekker. She acknowledged that this is unlikely to occur purely as a result of the upcoming trial, but hopes the results will provide the evidence needed by manufacturers and vaccine regulators to take it further.

"I don't think we are going to treat [our] way out of this epidemic, " added Gail Bekker. "We are ultimately going to need a vaccine to shut it down."

The first vaccines made available are unlikely to provide enough protection for use on their own, but will instead be needed in combination with the plethora of prevention, treatment and social interventions already in use.

It’s another blow for neuroscience. The discovery of major software flaws could render thousands of fMRI brain studies inaccurate.

The use of fMRI is a common method for scanning the brain in neuroscience and psychology experiments. To make sense of the data produced, researchers sometimes use a technique called spatial autocorrelation to identify areas of the brain that appear to “light up” during particular tasks or experiences. But some software flaws in the popular fMRI data analysis packages SPM, FSL and AFNI meant this technique routinely produced false positives, resulting in errors 50 per cent of the time or more.

Anders Eklund and Hans Knutsson at Linköping University in Sweden and Thomas Nichols at the University of Warwick, UK, calculated this by analysing brain data from a collaborative open fMRI project called 1000 Functional Connectomes. Most fMRI statistical methods have been developed using simulated data, but in this case the team was able to use real brain information to validate the techniques for identifying significant patterns of activity in fMRI scans.

This work enabled the researchers to confirm that a statistical software flaw they first identified in 2012 truly does produce false positives at an alarmingly high rate. Four years ago, they were not taken very seriously because their work at that time was based on data from a single person.

Now we know that this is a very real problem indeed. Although the software error has now been corrected, potentially thousands of fMRI studies are in doubt.

Dead fish

It isn’t the first time this field of research has taken a major hit. In 2009, a tongue-in-cheek study showed that some fMRI methods can detect statistically significant activity in a dead fish.

That study illustrated why it is essential to apply statistical corrections when an experiment involves multiple tests. If you ask enough questions, you will eventually detect an association that isn’t really there – unless you apply corrections that reduce the likelihood of such false positives.

The same problem is at the heart of the latest study. The software flaws identified by Eklund’s team involve the statistical corrections that were missing in the fish study, but sometimes the affected software packages did not apply them in the right way.

However, the elephant in the room is that when the team looked at 241 recent fMRI papers, it found that the researchers did not even ask their software to apply any kind of correction in 40 per cent of them. This means a large proportion of recent research probably contains the very same types of error highlighted by the dead fish study from seven years ago.

What’s the damage?

According to Eklund, it is difficult to determine which studies have been affected by the spatial autocorrelation flaw because raw data from past studies is rarely available.

Nichols estimates that around one in 10 fMRI studies may be affected. This is somewhat lower than the full “15 years of brain research” that some publications have suggested are now called into question.

However, when you take into account that, on top of the software flaw, a further 40 per cent of this type of study may be compromised by researchers failing to apply the right corrections in the first place, this hints that many studies indeed may have reported false positive results.

The types of study most likely to be affected are those that are usually reported with headlines along the lines of “X causes part Y of your brain to light up”, or “This is your brain on drug Z”. Those that show relatively weak statistical associations are the likeliest to be inaccurate – whereas studies reporting strongly significant findings may ultimately still be sound.

Read with caution

But not all fMRI researchers are worried. Jens Foell at Florida State University in Tallahassee likens fMRI to using a blurry magnifying glass to look at the most complex object in the universe. As a consequence, he says, we should always be sceptical of fMRI studies with results that have only borderline statistical significance.

In light of this growing evidence of the unreliability of some fMRI research, it is more important than ever to treat findings with caution. There is a large body of psychological evidence that shows people are particularly easily swayed by neuroscience. But although neuroscience is an important field, it is a young one that relies on inherently fuzzy data. Psychological studies that measure behaviour and actions directly may often be more useful, relevant and reliable.

“What I expect the fMRI research community to do now is neither to worry nor to be surprised, but to engage in rigorous discussion,” says Foell.

Yesterday, Meredith Corp. revealed that it, too, had joined the live video and virtual reality craze that seems to be sweeping the consumer publishing industry.

The women's publishing giant whose massive audience continues to grow — as of yesterday's statement, the company claims to reach 102 million unduplicated women in the U.S. — announced a commitment to expand its relatively nascent Facebook Live activity into a fully-fledged "video innovation" strategy encompassing live video, virtual reality, and 360º video.

The company wouldn't reveal specifics about upcoming initiatives planned once the new technology has been fully implemented, but Melinda Lee, Meredith's newly appointed SVP and GM of video, tells Folio: that the jump into the new formats comes as marketers are increasingly seeking those capabilities in publishers.

"We have developed creative expertise in VR and 360º in-house and are training all of our producers on these new production technologies," Lee tells Folio:. "We started by experimenting on more affordable cameras, but have recently made the investment in higher-end cameras, too."

Lee adds that the company is using open APIs at its studios in New York and Des Moines to ensure uniform quality and methodology across brands, further indicating that this is a company-wide strategy. A third studio, in Seattle, is scheduled to begin live video production later this year.

Whether on Facebook, Twitter, or elsewhere, live video is almost certainly the hottest new distribution channel of the summer for publishers. Immersive video experiences provided by virtual reality headsets seem to be gathering steam as well, with The New York Times Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and InStyle, among several others, already getting in on the action.

While Meredith seems no less bullish on the new video formats, Lee cautions that to fully realize the potential of any new medium, it is first necessary to attain a deep understanding of the technology and the ways in which audiences consume it.

"In order for content creators to fully utilize all the good things that live video and VR can bring to our audiences, we need to fully dive into engagement metrics and iterate on our ability to tell a good story through these new video production technologies," Lee tells Folio:. "Video insights are more important than ever and we have made an investment here."
Taylor Swift previously claimed Kanye West never told her he was going to rap, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous” in this year’s “Famous,” but a video Kim Kardashian posted on her Snapchat shows the pair did discuss the song.

In the clip, West recites the lyrics, “To all my southside n—-s that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex” to Swift on the phone, leaving out the last part of the lyric where West says he made Swift famous. She tells him to choose whatever line he thinks is best, and says, “It’s obviously very tongue-in-cheek either way… And I really appreciate you telling me about it. That’s really nice.”

“You gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way that you experienced it,” Swift says in a different part of the conversation, seemingly referring to 2009 when West stormed the stage while Swift was accepting the award for Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards. “You honestly didn’t know who I was before that. It doesn’t matter if I sold seven million of that album before you did that, which is what happened, you didn’t know who I was before that.”

Swift publicly responded soon after Kardashian posted the footage of the phone call: “That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet,” she posted alongside a note on Instagram.

“Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song?’” she wrote in the note. “It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world … While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard.”

She goes on to say, “Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.”

Soon after West debuted “Famous” this past February, a rep for Swift said, “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account. She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that bitch famous.’”

West responded to the controversy by saying via Twitter that he and Taylor had an hour-long phone conversation about the line, “and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.”

The lyric came up again in June when Kardashian, West’s wife, told GQ that Swift “totally approved” it.

“She totally knew that was coming out,” Kardashian said. “She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn’t.” Once the GQ story came out, Swift’s team released a statement claiming that “Taylor heard [‘Famous’] for the first time when everyone else did and was humiliated.”

More recently, Kardashian addressed why she defended West in a promo clip for Keeping Up With the Kardashians. “I just felt like I wanted to defend him,” she says in the video. “Because it’s like, she legitimately, quote, says, ‘As soon as I get on that Grammy red carpet, I’m gonna tell all the press I was in on it.’”

That is not what happened at the Grammys, which took place just days after the world first heard “Famous,” though. Instead, Swift seemingly referenced West in her acceptance speech for the Album of the Year award.

“There are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame,” she said. “But if you just focus on the work, and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, some day when you get where you’re going, you will look around and know it is you and the people who love you who put you there.”

Swift and “Famous” once again collided in June when West premiered the music video for the song, which features nude recreations of multiple celebrities, including Swift, lying next to each other in a giant bed.

These “Famous” developments come on the heels of the recent reveal that Swift wrote the lyrics for ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris’ “This Is What You Came For,” a single released in April when the two were still dating, under a pseudonym. Once Swift’s rep confirmed this, Harris responded on his Twitter, where he said, “Hurtful to me at this point that [Swift] and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though.”

“I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like KATY ETC,” he continued, referring to Swift’s rumored feud with Katy Perry, “but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it.”

West has not yet commented on Swift’s response to the Snapchat video.

The Japanese telecom and Internet company SoftBank is taking control of technology that powers most of the world’s mobile devices (and increasingly more besides).

The Japanese telecom and Internet company SoftBank is gaining control of technology used to run most of the world’s mobile devices and has the financial wherewithal to compete more aggressively with Intel.

SoftBank is spending $32 billion to buy ARM Holdings, which licenses the chips used in not just smartphones but also an increasing number of Internet-connected domestic appliances and now even supercomputers. Its chips are best known for their energy efficiency, which is why they’ve proven so popular—extending battery life in smartphones and cutting power bills for larger devices. Among the companies that license ARM’s designs are Apple, Qualcomm, and Nvidia.

Intel should be especially worried by the purchase. The once-dominant chipmaker missed the boat on chips for mobile devices, allowing ARM to dominate the sector. The takeover by Softbank could give ARM far more resources to invest in products that further erode Intel’s market share. Chief among those could be Internet of Things hardware, which its chips are well-suited to.

SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint in the U.S., among many other international properties, promises to maintain ARM’s brand-agnostic approach, in which it licenses technology to multiple partners. That will be worth watching. Given ARM’s dominant market position, even subtle changes to the ways in which it provides rights to processor designs could have a profound impact upon the smartphone and tablet industry.

People who knew Omar Mateen say the former security guard showed flashes of violence and intolerance before officials say he killed 49 people at a gay Orlando nightclub.

A fellow security guard who worked alongside Mateen in 2014 and 2015 described him to West Palm Beach’s WPTV as “an angry person, violent in nature and a bigot to almost every class of person.”

The coworker also told WPTV, “I saw it coming. I mean everything. He told me he was going to do it. Besides the date and the location, he said he was going to kill a whole bunch of people.”



Mateen’s ex-wife Sitora Yusufiy and others close to Mateen have also told news outlets that Mateen could be suddenly violent and abusive. According to the New York Times, Yusufiy said Mateen beat her and described him as “totally two different people sometimes, and would turn and abuse me, out of nowhere, when I was sleeping.” She also said he used anti-gay language.

Mateen’s wife, Noor, has reportedly told FBI officials that she drove Mateen to Pulse, where the attack occurred early Sunday morning, at least once. Noor said she tried to talk him out of attacking the nightclub, according to NBC News. The FBI is currently investigating whether Mateen was a regular at Pulse as multiple news outlets report that he visited several times and even contacted Pulse’s regulars on the dating app Grindr.

“Sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself, and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent,” Ty Smith, a Pulse club goer, told the Orlando Sentinel, which also reported that several Pulse attendees had seen Mateen in the club.

The Los Angeles Times reports that a man who regularly goes to Pulse had messaged with Mateen over the gay dating app Jack’d and spotted him near the club roughly an hour before the shooting.

Several news outlets are also reporting that Mateen visited Disney World earlier this month, potentially as surveillance for a possible shooting.

Members of Mateen’s mosque, located in Fort Pierce, Fla., remembered Mateen Monday as a visitor to his congregation. Marian Alladin, a retired schoolteacher, told TIME that Mateen had paid a condolence call to her husband after he broke his leg in an accident. “That kid came to my house, he came with his wife, his son, and he sat with him,” she recalled, saying he was “very pleasant, very sociable.”

His mother and sisters are just like the other ladies at the center, multiple women say. They are well respected in the congregation, and known as good members of the community. “He came from a very nice family,” Alladin says.

Following the shooting, Mateen’s father, Seddique, said his son was angered after recently seeing two men in public kissing and later released a video saying that God should be the one to decide punishment for homosexual behavior. But he told CNN that the shooting was “an act of terror” and that he doesn’t forgive his son for his action.

Seddique, who hosts a TV show broadcast from California and shown on a satellite Afghan TV station, has expressed sympathy for the Afghan Taliban and has appeared to pose as the leader of Afghanistan in online videos. According to the Washington Post, in one video Seddique called for the arrest of Afghanistan’s political leaders.

Shortly before the shooting, Mateen called 911 and pledged loyalty to the Islamic State, but officials say that the shooting at Pulse was “homegrown” and not part of a broader plot directed by ISIS at targets in the U.S. According to FBI Director James Comey, Mateen also previously expressed sympathy for both al-Qaeda and Hezbollah, two groups in the Middle East with conflicting ideologies.
Jon Paul Piques gained social-media fame posting bawdy six-second videos on Vine. In April, however, he used Facebook to live-stream a behind-the-scenes look at Playboy.

He had a big incentive: Facebook Inc. is paying Mr. Piques up to $119,000 to use its new Facebook Live streaming service at least five times a month through September.

The first year of the scheme will be funded with money from the overseas aid budget and the Government has already allocated £129 million to help local authorities with costs for the remaining years.

But it is unclear where the rest of the £589 million will come from.

Mr Vaz said he had written to the Prime Minister for clarification.

"This is a huge figure," the influential Labour MP said.

"The amount of money being spent on this scheme appears to be comparable to all other asylum accommodation delivered by the Government.

"As the Home Office refuses to provide regular updates on the numbers being resettled, or where they are being placed, there is an unacceptable lack of transparency in the use of these significant funds.
Kigali – South Sudan has topped the peace and security agenda at the recent African Union summit, with leaders looking for a "quick solution" to the recent outbreak of violence there.

AU peace and security commissioner Smail Chergui told journalists, following the end of the AU summit on Monday, that heads of states "indicated we have to be on the side of the people of South Sudan, but also (wanted to see) how we can find a quick solution to what happened and get back to the work of the transition government".

The AU has backed a request for more African troops to reinforce the United Nations mission in the country (UNMIS) with a "robust peace enforcement" mandate should violence break out there again.

"The UN does not have the mandate to impose peace," Chergui said. "They are there when there is peace to keep. That is the added value of African troops in African countries, they are ready to engage in difficult situations, even without the necessary equipment and personnel."

He said work also needed to start on implementing South Sudan’s peace agreement, which was facilitated by the AU and signed last year after violence broke out in 2013 in the world's newest country. South Sudan's five-year anniversary of independence was this month.

This agreement contained a timeline for working on reconciliation and healing.

The humanitarian crisis also needed to be addressed, Chergui said.

The regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development, together with the G5 – five countries tasked with supporting the peace talks, including South Africa – had a special meeting on Saturday evening to talk about developments.

In their communiqué, they called on the UN Security Council to extend UNMISS with a revised mandate to deploy a regional protection force to separate South Sudan’s warring parties.

There is no time frame as yet for the deployment, as it would depend on the UN’s response to the proposal.

Chergui said the AU also asked for "strict observance of the ceasefire", which he said was holding after a brief outbreak of violence in the capital Juba earlier this month.

He said the warring parties also needed to get back to working on building the transitional government, which formed part of the peace agreement.

President Jacob Zuma, who attended the IGAD plus G5 meeting on Saturday, said: "As the youngest country on the continent, we should continue to assist South Sudan in nation-building."

In a statement issued by the Presidency, he said South Sudan was a priority for South Africa partly because the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) has been very close to the ANC and other former liberation movements on the continent.

Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is Zuma's Special Envoy to South Sudan and has been involved in efforts to help reconcile the warring factions in the party.

Burundi - where the recent assassination of Hasfa Mossi, a member of the East African Legislative Assembly and former Burundian minister, has caused shockwaves - was also discussed, Chergui said. The AU was concerned about the targeted assassinations, the violation of human rights and the plight of displaced people and refugees at a time of economic difficulties.

The AU’s Peace and Security Council travelled to Burundi last month to look at how it could improve the inclusive dialogue between Burundians.

However, all indications at the summit were that this could be an uphill process, after Burundi recalled its delegation to the summit last Monday, with the way the dialogue was being conducted reportedly being one of their objections.

Libya, Mali, Somalia and a special fund to fight terrorism also featured in the AU’s discussions on security.
Giving up Google wasn’t easy for Stephanie Hannon, if it’s easy for anyone. A person can get used to the big salary, cushy perks, and creative time Silicon Valley’s top employers offer. Plus, she was working on cool, potentially life-saving stuff, like tools to assist in natural disasters. The tech life was good.

Then, in February 2015, Democratic digital guru Teddy Goff asked her to serve as chief technology officer for Hillary Clinton’s yet-to-be-announced bid for president. And Hannon remembers thinking, “Is this the leap I want to make?”

The thing is, political campaigns come with all of Silicon Valley’s gruel but none of the glory. You barely have time to sleep, much less innovate for the sheer joy of the technology. And resources are limited. But as someone who worked for so long in an industry that has so few women at the top, Hannon knew what her decision had to be. “The journey to put the first woman in the White House was just too big not to be part of,” she says.

Now she’s trying to convince Silicon Valley’s finest to do the same. And so far, it’s working. Clinton’s tech team is already shaping up to be the largest in campaign history, and possibly the smartest. With the general election four months away, Hannon has assembled a team of more than 50 engineers and developers who left lucrative careers at places like Google, Facebook, and Twitter to help code Clinton’s way to more votes, more dollars, and, if all goes according to plan, the White House.

That Clinton would have a sizable tech team this year isn’t at all unusual. In 2012, President Obama’s campaign attracted technologists with similarly stacked resumes, and his tech advantage helped him win the election. Today, a solid tech foundation is an expectation for any presidential aspirant.

At least, that’s what one of the two major candidates this year seems to think.

‘What technology does is gives us an edge in places where things are close.’ Kyle Rush, Deputy CTO, Clinton Campaign

While Donald Trump has used the cable news cycle and social media masterfully to garner attention over the last year, he only hired an in-house digital director last month. And that, people familiar with the campaign say, is about the extent of his tech team. (The Trump campaign wouldn’t comment.) In other words, with just four months until election day, Trump’s chances of catching up tech-wise are slim. Clinton’s tech team is already the size of a well-staffed startup and has had a year-long head start testing itself in primary contests across the country.

Yet, as with so much else this election cycle, a niggling doubt remains: maybe the conventional wisdom is wrong. Maybe you don’t need to spend all this money on industrial-grade tech to become president. Maybe you just need a killer Twitter feed. Yet even if that’s true—and it probably isn’t—Trump’s tech deficit presents a bigger problem for Republicans. The GOP has persistently lagged Democrats when it comes to good tech tools. The Trump campaign’s apathy may only leave the party farther behind.

No Votes for Innovation

During the 2012 election, President Obama’s technology team got a tremendous amount of credit for helping him defeat Mitt Romney. But ask anyone who worked on Obama’s campaign, and they’ll tell you that shiny tech alone doesn’t win elections.

“It’s a mistake for a campaign to think that it’s in the business of innovation,” says Goff, who was Obama’s 2012 digital director before joining the Clinton campaign. “A campaign is in the business of recruiting volunteers, registering voters, persuading people, and raising money.”

But better tech can make those crucial tasks easier and more efficient. And in a post-Bush versus Gore world, where no single vote can be left to chance, that means even incremental advantages can be the difference between winning and losing. That’s why in 2012 the major presidential campaigns entered the business of building technology themselves.

During the 2008 election cycle, the campaign relied heavily on existing tech platforms. “We didn’t build a lot of tech in ‘08,” says Obama’s then-CTO Michael Slaby. “We didn’t have the time or resources. We were opportunistic consumers of new things.” But in 2012, facing no primary competitors, Obama’s team had time to build and crash-test products from scratch. That led to new tools such as the massive voter management database Narwhal, which stitched together different buckets of voter data to paint a more complete picture of who the campaign should target. That effort inspired the Romney campaign to build its own voter database, Orca, which famously crashed on Election Day.

In the process, Democrats gained a wealth of institutional knowledge the Clinton campaign has used as a blueprint. Now, members of Clinton’s tech team say their task isn’t so much to invent the next big thing in political tech. It’s to ensure that all of the little things work a lot better.

“There’s a danger in not solving real problems because you’re looking for the big shiny thing,” says Clinton’s chief product officer Osi Imeokparia, who spent nearly a decade at Google as product management director. “If you can increase the efficiency of the very simple things, you see it pay back in dividends.”

Evolution, Not Revolution

In many ways, the approach Imeokparia describes mirrors Clinton’s overall campaign strategy. The presumptive Democratic nominee portrays herself as the candidate of evolution, not revolution—a sharp contrast to the sweeping promises of Bernie Sanders and Trump.

“Together, we won’t just make promises we can’t keep,” Clinton said during the Democratic primary debate in New York City. “We’ll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America.”

GOP strategists see Trump’s approach as a series of missed opportunities.

The tech team’s strategy is in line with that ethos. It’s also consistent with Hannon’s own philosophy. Though Hannon came up as an engineer, her role at Google required understanding not just how tech tools get built but also the practical needs of the people who use them. In the world of a campaigning, those people are the donors, voters, field staffers, internal staff, and volunteers on the ground. Their needs are specific, and they might not sound sexy as part of a pitch deck for a VC. But building tools to meet their needs has proven crucial to pitching voters.

And so, within her first few weeks, Hannon had already gone door-knocking in Iowa to find out how or if tech could improve the traditionally paper-based process of getting out the vote. By January, she had assembled a staff of more than 30 (about the size of the tech team Obama had on Election Day in 2012) and was sending them out to do the same.

“If we can get three more door knocks out of every person, that’s a big deal,” Hannon says. “If we can spare 15 minutes of an organizer’s day not to have to do contact management, so it can be automated, that’s a big deal.”

Incremental Gains

Those incremental gains may not be the kind of stuff that makes for big headlines, but it’s the kind of thing that can make a big difference.

“Technology doesn’t ever win elections,” says Kyle Rush, Clinton’s deputy CTO, who joined the campaign from marketing tech outfit Optimizely and also worked on Obama’s 2012 team. “But I think what technology does is gives us an edge in places where things are close.”

For example, one of the campaign’s more successful subtle tweaks was a change it made to a landing page where donors can save their credit card information. As any e-commerce company could tell you, this step is key to converting people from window shoppers to paying customers. The same holds true in politics.

‘If we can get three more door knocks out of every person, that’s a big deal.’ Stephanie Hannon, CTO, Clinton campaign

So the Clinton campaign ran A/B tests to find a page design that would convince the maximum number of donors to store their data. The first design required three separate clicks, and donors had to enter an email address, create a password, and confirm that password before the process was complete. The second design pre-populated the donor’s email address and required one less click. That simple change led to a nearly 240 percent increase in the number of donors who were saving their credit cards.

Clinton’s tech team has also acted as a stopgap in times of crisis. Last year, for example, an outside vendor’s email service crashed the day of the Federal Election Commission’s deadline for reporting campaign contributions. Campaigns typically use that day to make a final fundraising push for the quarter to ensure the number they file looks as glowingly high as possible. In four hours, the Clinton campaign cobbled together a makeshift email system, codenamed Balloon, that brought in $700,000.

“Those are the moments I live for in this campaign, people coming together to solve really hard problems at a pace that doesn’t exist in any other job that I’ve seen,” says Deepa Subramaniam, an Adobe alum who now oversees Clinton’s donation tool.

A Lost Year

Having tech talent on the inside can accomplish a lot. But it’s hard to ignore just how much other candidates have accomplished without it.

During primary season, Sanders defied the odds by winning 22 primary races and out-raised the Clinton campaign several months in a row, all by relying heavily on an outside consulting firm and a vast army of volunteer technologists.

Trump, meanwhile, has built a winning campaign by making expert use of existing platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, forgoing the more granular voter targeting tactics competitors like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz used.

His approach raises tricky questions about the real value of building an internal tech stack. “He obviously has enough tech for the campaign he’s running,” says one former Obama 2012 staffer. “Is it the same tech as Hillary Clinton? No. Does it need to be? Probably not.”

The difference between the two campaigns is emblematic of their overarching strategies, says Slaby, whose company, The Groundwork, has worked with the Clinton campaign this cycle. Where Clinton’s team is using scratch-built tools to shave off time for volunteers and staffers and make her ground game more efficient, Trump is running a national strategy, using television and social media to get his message into every household.

“It’s not like he’s not using technology,” Slaby says. “It’s just that the tech needed to backup his strategy is Twitter.”

But that’s a big gamble, Slaby adds. Yes, this has been an unconventional election, and yes, both Clinton and Trump are already household names. It’s possible that no amount of targeting could ever change voters’ minds when both candidates are such known quantities. But the last two elections have powerfully suggested otherwise. Why leave it to chance this time around?

That line of criticism isn’t just coming from Democrats. Republican strategists who went through the 2012 cycle with Romney see Trump’s approach as a series of missed opportunities. “They’re just underperforming at everything they do,” said one former Romney staffer. “If they raise $10 million, they should have raised $20 million. Nothing they do maximizes the opportunities in front of them.”

That’s not just bad for Trump. It’s bad for the party, the Romney staffer says. Presidential campaigns tend to serve as political research and development incubators. These campaigns are the only time when the parties have access to both big budgets and the opportunity to try out new tools on a national scale. Thanks to the Obama campaign and the Howard Dean campaign before it in 2004, the Democrats have tended to have a head start on campaign tech, passing their knowledge on from one campaign to the next.

After Romney lost to Obama, the Republican party acknowledged it needed to invest in tech, and a series of startups spun out of the Romney campaign to help GOP candidates do just that. This cycle, Trump has ignored that lesson (and so many others). And he has ridden that iconoclasm to success, in part because his fame and outsized personality transcend political norms. But just because it’s worked for Trump doesn’t mean it will work for other Republicans down the line.

For those GOPers who still care about the future of the party, that’s a scary thought.

“The Democrats are going to come out of this, win or lose, with another 1,000 people who have really big ideas about campaigns and tech,” the Romney staffer says. “It’s almost like a lost cycle for Republicans.”

In the meantime, Hannon says she’s hiring.
The gunman who opened fire at a Florida nightclub last month had complained he was repeatedly taunted for being Muslim in his job as a Florida courthouse guard, according to records released on Monday.

Omar Mateen responded to the taunts by telling co-workers he had connections to terrorists and a mass shooter, but he later told his bosses he had made that up to get them off his back, and the FBI determined he was not a threat.

“I love the United States. The boasting I did it just to satisfy the gang of co-workers who ganged up against me,” Mateen wrote in a letter to his bosses at G4S Secure Solutions, according to the documents released by the St Lucie county sheriff’s office. “I’m 1,000% pure American ... I’m against these terrorists anyone of them.”

Mateen opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando during “Latin night” on 12 June in a rampage that left 49 dead and 53 wounded. It was the worst mass shooting in modern US history. Mateen, who pledged allegiance to Isis during a call with police dispatchers amid a three-hour standoff, died after police stormed the venue.

Mateen was born in New York and his family came from Afghanistan. According to the records, he told his bosses that when he started working at the St Lucie courthouse, one guard told deputies he was “a Muslim extremist and potential terrorist”.

When boxes were delivered to the courthouse, another guard often said: “We have to be careful Omar may send us a bomb and he will get his 72 virgins,” Mateen wrote, according to the records.

Another time, a deputy said his fingers had pork oil on them and he was going to rub them on Mateen’s shirt, according to Mateen.

Mateen told his bosses that in response to the taunting, he told co-workers he had ties to the Boston marathon bombing suspects and Nidal Hasan, a former US Army major who was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood in Texas that left 13 people dead and 31 wounded.

Mateen’s remarks prompted an FBI investigation in 2013 and caused enough concern with the St Lucie county sheriff’s office that officials there asked G4S Secure Solutions to have him reassigned, away from the courthouse. But in addition to Mateen’s explanation to his bosses that he had made up the story, the documents show the FBI didn’t believe he was a terrorist, and an agent told a sheriff’s office major he didn’t think Mateen “would go postal or anything like that”.

The FBI investigated Mateen again in 2014 because of his ties to a Syrian suicide bomber who went to the same mosque, but that case also was closed without the agency taking action.

FBI spokeswoman Amy Pittman on Monday referred questions to the FBI’s Miami office. Miami office spokesman Michael D. Leverock said he could not comment because the case was still under investigation.
Police And Black Lives Matter Hold A Cookout, And Praise Rolls In

i toggle caption Wichita Police Wichita Police

Members of the Wichita, Kan., police department spent Sunday afternoon eating and talking with people from the community, at a cookout that was planned with the local Black Lives Matter group.

The event was called the First Steps Community Cookout — a reference to its goal of bridging the gap between police and the community they serve. Taking place instead of a protest that had been planned for Sunday, the cookout came about after Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay had a lengthy meeting with activist A.J. Bohannon and other members of the local Black Lives Matter movement.

Bohannon told member station KMUW that the cookout gained even more importance after news emerged of a gunman's deadly attack on police officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday morning.

"We can get on the same page and say those things that are in Baton Rouge don't trickle over into Wichita, Kan.," Bohannan told KMUW. "My heart goes out to the families, those officers in Baton Rouge, but I think the fact that that did happen makes this event more meaningful. I definitely think this is a start for this community, and I definitely want to keep it going."

Photos from the scene show uniformed police officers — many of them wearing radios and other gear they use on patrol — talking with smiling residents, dancing and playing basketball at McAdams Park.

The cookout was a hit on social media, with Wichita Mayor Jeff Longwell noting that on his Facebook feed, news about police hanging out and dancing with would-be protesters had risen above the feud between Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian to top the list of trending topics.

One photo in particular drew some notice because of a young man's unsmiling pose alongside several officers — but that young man, MarQuell Woods, later posted an update on his Facebook page, declaring that he was "playing ball with students from West High School. I should have smiled I guess but we had fun."

A woman who says her kids are in the photo echoed that idea, calling the event historic and saying, "It was a bonding moment where the police saw them as children and my [sons] got to see them as people! It was a great first step Chief Gordon Ramsey and Wichita PD!"

The Wichita Eagle reports on another scene from the cookout:

"At one table, three men — a black man, a Hispanic man and a white man — sat down with burgers next to police Lt. Travis Rakestraw to share their ideas. "It was the first time since 1992 that Jarvis Scott, the black man, said he'd sat down with a police officer, and the other two said it was their first time ever sitting down with an officer."

After the event, Ramsay thanked those who came — and issued a challenge to other police departments to hold similar barbecues.

"It takes two parties to make a healthy relationship," the police chief said.

In response to one of the department's many tweets about the barbecue, one Twitter user wrote, "This makes me happy! First time in a while that anything in the news made me smile. There is hope."

The cookout also echoes a theme that we here at NPR have been covering lately: noncomplementary behavior, the act of departing from an established script when that script is likely to lead to conflict. In this case, both sides departed from what could have been a now-familiar story of clashes between protesters and police.

Our friends at the Invisibilia podcast explored other examples of noncomplementary behavior in their most recent episode.
We are familiar with Donald Trump’s stance on climate change: it’s a “con job” perpetrated by the Chinese. His views on energy policy are strongly pro-coal, but also contradict themselves. The Republican Party’s 2016 platform also describes coal as a “clean” source of energy.

But the Democratic platform might not be meaningfully better. Although Hillary Clinton has a climate change plan, and it is supportive of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan (which is held up in the courts), and makes broad promises to cut subsidies for the oil and gas industry, it leaves out one big thing: a carbon tax.

Under Obama, America has now made promises to have half of its electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2025—an almost unthinkable goal, even though emissions have ebbed in the last few years. The Clean Power Plan would help, if it is ever implemented: the EPA estimates the plan could cut carbon emissions from the energy sector to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. But it makes almost no attempt to tell states how to cut their emissions, only that they must.

Among the many possible methods states might employ is putting a price on carbon. This can take various forms, such as a cap-and-trade scheme or a straight-up fee for each ton of carbon a power plant emits. Using market forces to reduce pollution from the energy industry works: it has happened before. In fact, it’s the only thing that’s likely to spur the kind of change Obama has promised, and that is needed to curtail global warming. But anything that could be labeled a “tax” is a political third rail.

Until this week, Bernie Sanders was the only presidential candidate who espoused a carbon tax. Now that he has ceded the field to Clinton, the idea is unlikely to come anywhere near conversation for the rest of the 2016 election cycle. And, unfortunately, neither is meaningful action on climate change.

Women’s groups in Brazil are set to challenge the abortion laws this summer in the hope of making a safe and legal termination possible for women at risk of delivering a baby born with defects after exposure to the Zika virus.



“Women should be able to decide and have the means to terminate pregnancies because they are facing serious risks of having babies with microcephaly and also suffering huge mental distress during their pregnancies. They should not be forced to carry on their pregnancies under the circumstances,” said Beatriz Galli, a lawyer on bioethics and human rights who works for Ipas, a group dedicated to ending unsafe abortion.

Lawyers for the organisations will present a legal challenge at the supreme court in the first week of August, when the court sits again after the winter break. They are co-ordinated by Anis Instituto de Bioética, which campaigns for women’s equality and reproductive rights.

Related: UN tells Latin American countries hit by Zika to allow women access to abortion

The groups have obtained an opinion from lawyers at Yale University in the US, who argue that the Brazilian government’s policies on Zika and microcephaly have breached women’s human rights. The government “has failed to enact adequate measures to ensure that all women have access to comprehensive reproductive health information and options, as required by Brazil’s public health and human rights commitments”, says a review from the Global Health Justice Partnership, which is a joint initiative of the Yale Law School and the Yale School of Public Health.

It is also critical of Brazil’s handling of the epidemic. Its “failure to ensure adequate infrastructure, public health resources and mosquito control programmes in certain areas has greatly exacerbated the Zika and Zika-related microcephaly epidemics, particularly among poor women of racial minorities”, the review says.

As of 7 July, there have been 1,638 cases of reported microcephaly – an abnormally small head – and other brain defects in Brazil, according to the World Health Organisation. Women who do not want to continue their pregnancy because they have been infected, even if they have had a scan confirming brain defects in the baby, are unable to choose a legal termination. There is evidence of a rise in early abortions using pills obtainable online and fears that unsafe, illegal abortions will be rising too.

Galli said there were already about 200,000 hospitalisations of women who have undergone a clandestine termination every year, and a suspected 1 million illegal abortions before the epidemic. “We know that there are clinics operating in the very low-income poor settings in Rio and women are paying a lot of money and are risking their lives,” she said.

Campaigners who want to change the law are encouraged by a ruling the supreme court handed down in the case of babies with anencephaly in 2012. This is a condition where the foetus develops without a brain, making it impossible for the baby to be born alive. The case took eight years, but eventually the court voted eight to two in favour of making abortion legal in those circumstances.

Before the ruling, there were two exceptions to the ban on termination in Brazil – when the pregnant woman’s life was at risk and when she had been raped. Anencephaly became the third, but campaigners acknowledge that it is not a simple precedent.

Debora Diniz, co-founder of Anis and professor of law at the University of Brasilia, said she was confident the court would understand that the situation is an emergency. They were not asking for the legalisation of abortion, she said, but “to have the right to abortion in the case of Zika infection during the epidemic”.

“It is not an abortion in the case of foetal malformation. It is the right to abortion in case of being infected by the Zika virus, suffering mental stress because you have this horrible situation and so few answers on how to plan and have a safe pregnancy,” she said.

Related: Abortion rights around the world – interactive

Campaigners have five demands: good information for women in pregnancy, improvements in access to family planning, giving women mosquito repellents, better social policies to help children born with birth defects because of Zika and financial support for parents.

Diniz points out that the worst hit are the poor. “The feeling in my well-to-do neighbourhood [in Brasilia] is that everything is fine,” she said. People have never met a woman with Zika or seen a baby with neurological defects. But when she goes to clinics in hard-hit areas such as Campina Grande in the north-east, everything revolves around Zika.

“We have two countries in one country,” she said. “This is an emergency of unknown women. The trouble is they were unknown before the epidemic. I’m not being an opportunist. We have an epidemic and the epidemic shows the face of Brazilian inequality.”
Access Facebook from the western half of North America and there’s a good chance your data will be pulled from a computer cooled by the juniper- and sage-scented air of central Oregon’s high desert.

In the town of Prineville, home to roughly 9,000 people, Facebook stores the data of hundreds of millions more. Rows and rows of computers stand inside four giant buildings totaling nearly 800,000 square feet, precisely aligned to let in the dry and generally cool summer winds that blow in from the northwest. The aisles of stacked servers with blinking blue and green lights make a dull roar as they process logins, likes, and LOLs.

Facebook has installed new high-powered servers to help its artificial intelligence researchers move faster. They are powered by GPU chips (the green cards at the back of the image) made by Nvidia.

Facebook has lately added some new machines to the mix in Prineville. The company has installed new, high-powered servers designed to speed up efforts to train software to do things like translate posts between languages, be a smarter virtual assistant, or follow written narratives.

Facebook’s new Big Sur servers are designed around high-powered processors of a kind originally developed for graphics processing, known as GPUs. These chips underpin recent leaps in artificial intelligence technology that have come from a technique known as deep learning. Software has become strikingly better at understanding images and speech thanks to the power of GPUs allowing old ideas about how to train software to be applied to much larger, more complex data sets (see “Teaching Machines to Understand Us”).

Kevin Lee, an engineer at Facebook who works on the servers, says they help Facebook’s researchers train software using more data, by working faster. “These servers are purpose-built hardware for AI research and machine learning,” he says. “GPUs can take a photo and split it into tiny pieces and work on them all at once.”

Facebook builds each Big Sur server around eight GPUs made by Nvidia, the leading supplier of such chips. Lee declined to say exactly how many of the servers have been deployed but said the company has “thousands” of GPUs at work. Big Sur servers have been installed in the company’s Prineville and Ashburn, Virginia, data centers.

Because GPUs are extremely power hungry, Facebook has to pack them less densely than it does other types of server in the data center, to avoid creating hot spots that would make things harder for the cooling system and require extra power. Eight Big Sur servers are stacked into a seven-foot-tall rack that might otherwise hold 30 standard Facebook servers that do the more routine work of serving up user data.

Facebook is far from alone in running giant data centers or collecting GPUs to power machine learning research. Microsoft, Google, and Chinese search company Baidu have all relied on GPUs to power deep learning research.

Facebook’s new servers for artificial intelligence research, inside the company’s data center in Prineville, Oregon.

The social network is unusual in that it has opened up the designs for Big Sur and its other server designs, as well as the plans for its Prineville data center. The company contributes them to a nonprofit called the Open Compute Project, started by Facebook in 2011 to encourage computing companies to work together on designs for low-cost, high-efficiency data center hardware. The project is seen as having helped Asian hardware companies and squeezing traditional vendors such as Dell and HP.

Facebook’s director of AI research, Yann LeCun, said when Big Sur was announced earlier this year that he believed making the designs available could accelerate progress in the field by enabling more organizations to build powerful machine learning infrastructure (see “Facebook Joins Stampede of Tech Giants Giving Away Artificial Intelligence Technology”).

Future machine learning servers built on Facebook’s plans may not be built around the GPUs at their heart today, though. Multiple companies are working on new chip designs more specifically tailored to the math of deep learning than GPUs.

Google announced in May that it had started using a chip of its own design, called a TPU, to power deep learning software in products such as speech recognition. The current chip appears to be suited to running algorithms after they have been trained, not the initial training step that Big Sur servers are designed to expedite, but Google is working on a second-generation chip. Nvidia and several startups including Nervana Systems are also working on chips customized for deep learning (see “Intel Outside As Other Companies Prosper from AI Chips”).

Eugenio Culurciello, an associate professor at Purdue University, says that the usefulness of deep learning means such chips look sure to be very widely used. “There’s been a big need for a while and it’s only growing,” he says.

Asked whether Facebook was working on its own custom chips, Lee says the company is “looking into it.”
CLEVELAND ― Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani delivered a fire-breathing endorsement of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump during his primetime speaking slot at the opening of the Republican National Convention Monday ― and managed to do it without mentioning 9/11.

It was a remarkable feat for Giuliani, who rose to fame on his response to the 2001 terror attacks, but was memorably mocked by then-Sen. Joe Biden for constructing every sentence as “noun, verb, 9/11.”

Instead, Giuliani launched a vigorous defense of police and echoed the chorus of Republicans arguing that America is in serious danger.

“The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe. They fear for their children,” Giuliani said, blaming President Barack Obama, although serious crime is down about 16 percent since Obama took office.

Giuliani did veer toward 9/11 once, but it was to mention a word that is far more popular among Republicans these days: Benghazi, a topic previous speakers had already dwelled on for more than half an hour.

“Her dereliction of duty and failure to keep her people safe played a major role, as you heard tonight, and the horrific Islamic terrorist murders on Sept. 11 and 12 ― 2012 ― in Benghazi,” Giuliani said, ignoring as every other speaker did, the nine Libya investigations that all failed to blame Clinton.

Last February, I wrote that Chief of the Defence Staff General Jonathan Vance said Canada "will certainly be involved somehow" in Libya.

"I don't know whether we will be involved militarily, but we will certainly be involved somehow, because Libya sits at a crossroads of some very important and dangerous things that are happening in the world," Vance said.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also said Canada could join a coalition in Libya to fight ISIS. However, in a conference call last Wednesday, Sajjan confirmed his government was considering a number of United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions but no further details were given.

Considering the fact that UN peacekeeping missions are not aimed at taking part in offensive operations, Canada will most likely not join a coalition to "fight" ISIS.

However, last Thursday, Lieutenant General Paul Wynnyk became the commander of the Canadian Army and quickly stated the Canadian Army could possibly deploy troops in Africa. As a matter of fact, according to Wynnyk, a deployment to Africa was imminent.

Although many regions in Africa would benefit from having Canadian soldiers on the ground, Mali has been mentioned on many occasions. When the French government deployed troops to drive out Islamic extremists in early 2014, Canada contributed by sending CC-177 Globemaster III strategic lifters.

France has been requesting Canada's aid to take a major role in the UN peacekeeping mission after its intervention in Mali, according to documents obtained by CBC.

Based on the fact that the French government has a high number of troops deployed domestically to counter recent terror attacks, President Francois Hollande most likely turned to Canada due to its past logistical participation, and the fact that many Canadian soldiers can speak French -- one of the main spoken languages in Mali.

According to Walter Dorn, a professor at the Canadian Force Staff College in Kingston, Canada could supply up to 1,000 soldiers to a UN mission. Dorn believes Canada could sustain a deployed contingent of more than 1,000 troops for many years.

The Canadian Forces will be stretched out and with more than $3.7 billion in slashed military spending until 2020, deployed troops will most likely have logistical issues and equipment problems. With different missions in different parts of the world, the logistical branch of the Canadian Forces will have to pull miracles to keep soldiers well-supplied and in fighting shape.

That said, with a deployed contingent in Ukraine, Poland and soon Latvia, Canada will most likely draft an option to involve in Special Operations Forces elements.

Could CANSOFCOM deploy in Mali?

Due to a significant number of French troops deployed in Mali, the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM) could very well deploy to the African country with a training mission in mind.

CANSOFCOM could assist in the rebuilding of the security sector, one of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) main focus.

The Canadian Special Operations Regiment (CSOR) has been actively taking part in Exercise Flintlock, an annual exercise in Africa. Malian soldiers have taken part in Exercise Flintlock in the past, according to the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM).

This exercise gave CSOR good interoperability experience with African soldiers, as well as with NATO allies currently participating in a number of operations on the continent.

"Exercise Flintlock is designed to foster regional cooperation to enable our African partners to stabilize regions of North and West Africa, reducing sanctuary and support for violent extremist organizations. Exercise Flintlock provides increased interoperability, counterterrorism, and combat skills training while creating a venue for regional engagement among all TSCTP nations."

Yet, if Canada agrees on sending UN peacekeeping troops in Mali to relieve French troops, CANSOFCOM will not play a major role in the West African country.

The Canadian Forces presently have troops deployed with the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of South Sudan.

Kensington Palace confirmed the engagement in a statement later Tuesday saying that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge — better known as Prince William and Kate — were "absolutely delighted with the news."

The 32-year-old sister of the Duchess of Cambridge will reportedly marry James Matthews, 40, next year.

The couple were recently seen watching the tennis together at the Wimbledon championships in London.

Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan will produce via their Warners-based shingle.

Warner Bros. has preemptively picked up Worst Tinder Date Ever, an original romantic comedy pitch from writers Keith Merryman and David A. Newman.

Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan will produce via their Warners-based shingle.

The rom-com with action elements centers on two people in Los Angeles that go on a Tinder date that spirals into a night of one disaster after disaster — and, of course, they fall for one another in the process.

Niija Kuykendall and Julia Spiro are overseeing for the studio. Sources say part of the inspiration for the project was one of Spiro's own bad dates.

Sources say the deal was in the high six figures.

Merryman and Newman know a thing or two about rom-coms, having scripted three this decade: the 2011 Justin Timberlake-Mila Kunis hit Friends With Benefits and the 2012 and 2014 installments of the Think Like a Man franchise.

The duo recently wrote Lionsgate’s remake of the family comedy Instructions Not Included, the highest-grossing Spanish-language film ever released in the U.S. They also have revenge comedy The Ex Games set up at CBS Films.

Merryman and Newman are repped by APA, Writ Large and SMGSB.
No one likes to feel left out. And you know what’s just as bad? Getting locked out. But the very worst is getting locked out and awkwardly waiting for someone to let you back in, a diabolical combination of both fears that plays out at least once a week in the offices of The Atlantic.

We’re a modern, security-conscious workplace: Our office doors require employees to wave a fob over a reader before letting them into the main office. That means every time an Atlanticker heads to the elevators or uses the restrooms—both of which are outside the secured zone—they have to remember to take their keys along.

And I, for one, often forget. So I’m locked out. And then comes the awkwardness. Sometimes I pretend to be on my phone until someone leaves the office, at which point I’ll theatrically end my conversation and grab the door. But when that fails, there’s no getting around it: I’m reduced to knocking on the glass and sheepishly waiting for a coworker to fetch get me.

My second #MakeEveryWeek project seeks to solve this. The Atlantic essentially needed a doorbell. But not an actual doorbell; I fear that the incessant ringing of the Westminster Chimes would drive nearby coworkers to fits. My solution instead connects to Slack, our workplace chat client, and alerts a special channel that someone needs to be let into the office.

That this was easy to do is largely thanks to Amazon’s new Internet of Things Button, a customizable variant of their Dash buttons (which are hard-coded to order specific products) that connects to WiFi and sends instructions over the internet. My code (technical explanation here) includes a random quote about doors to Slack message—not only does the variety liven things up, but it also makes it easier to tell door requests apart.

Here’s what the doorbell looks like:

This project won’t protect me from forgetting my keys. But it will save me the embarrassment of admitting I forgot my keys.

Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim announced that the United States has been given evidence of exiled opposition leader Fethullah Gulen's "involvement" in the failed coup, as he warned that further "criminal activity will be forcefully dealt with".

In an address on Tuesday before members of his party in parliament, Yildirim denounced the "despicable" and "cowardly" coup plotters, whom he said were being "directed by a cleric" from abroad, referring to Gulen.

"The power of the tank has not been able to overcome the power of the people," he said, adding that all those involved in the coup will be "severely punished".

Turks pessimistic about future after coup attempt

Yildirim did not say whether the evidence provided by the Turkish government to the US constitutes a formal extradition request.

But later on Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Turkish government had filed materials in electronic form with the US government, which were in review.

Ankara had earlier demanded Washington hand Gulen over to Turkish authorities.

Gulen, who is resident in the US, has denied any involvement in the military plot to topple the government of President Recep Tayipp Erdogan, and hinted that the coup might have been staged to justify his arrest.

Yildirim's speech came as the government detains government workers, including police officers, members of the civil service and the judiciary.

Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Istanbul, said as many as 20,000 government employees have been detained, or are being pursued by the authorities, including 185 admirals and colonels, and 1,500 finance ministry officials.

Reuters also reported that 257 personnel from the prime minister's own office have also been removed from duty.

Turkey's Education Ministry on Tuesday suspended 15,200 personnel in connection with the failed coup, state media reported. Later, the High Education Board ordered the resignation of all 1,577 deans employed at all universities, TRT reported.

Turkey's religious directorate issued a statement on Tuesday, saying it would not offer religious funerary services, including funeral prayers, for soldiers involved in the failed coup attempt, except for those who had been "forcibly dragged" into the military actions attempting to overthrow the government.

'Serious alarm'

Yildirim said that the government will make a major announcement on Wednesday in response to the coup attempt.

He did not specify what action the government would take, but earlier on Tuesday, President Erdogan said he is ready to reinstate the death penalty.

"There is no time to rest," Yildirim said to cheers from party colleagues. "There is a group of people who are going to be punished."

A top United Nations human rights official urged Turkey to uphold the rule of law, and voiced "serious alarm" at the mass suspension of judges and prosecutors.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein also called for independent observers to visit places of detention in Turkey to check on conditions, and for detainees to have access to lawyers and their families.

"In the aftermath of such a traumatic experience, it is particularly crucial to ensure that human rights are not squandered in the name of security and in the rush to punish those perceived to be responsible," Zeid said in a statement.

"Reintroduction of the death penalty would be in breach of Turkey's obligations under international human rights law - a big step in the wrong direction," he said.

The European Union has also warned that Turkey's accession to the European Union would halted if the death penalty is reinstated.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack that resulted in police killing the attacker, a 17-year-old Afghan asylum-seeker.

What we know on Tuesday: —A 17-year Afghan asylum-seeker, armed with an axe and a knife, attacked a passenger train in central Germany, injuring four people. He was shot by police and killed on the scene. —The Islamic State claimed responsibility, but a senior Bavarian official said it appears the suspect acted alone. —We’re live-blogging the major updates. All updates are in Eastern Daylight Time (GMT -4). 10:25 a.m. Tuesday A video reportedly released by the Islamic State on Tuesday appears to show the person who authorities say is responsible for the attack. In it, he speaks to the camera with a knife in his hand. Prosecutors now say that two of the victims in Monday’s attack are suffering from “acute life-threatening” wounds. 7:12 a.m. Tuesday The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq news agency. SITE, the terrorism-monitoring center, pointed out that Amaq said the attack was carried out by an ISIS “soldier,” language similar to what it used to claim the attack last week in Nice, France.

Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, speaking on television, said a hand-painted ISIS flag was found in the room of the 17-year-old who carried out Monday’s attack. He said the suspect had lived in Wuerzburg since March, in a home for minors who had traveled alone to Germany to seek asylum. Here’s more via Deutsche Welle: Herrmann had earlier said investigators were following every lead to determine the teenager's motive and it was too early to say whether he had an Islamist background. So far, it was understood that he had acted alone. The teenager, Herrmann said in another TV interview, had boarded the train in Ochsenfurt, where he was living with a foster family. Here’s more: "He suddenly attacked passengers with a knife and an axe, critically injuring several. Some of them may now be fighting for their lives." The Afghan national reportedly shouted "Allahu Akbar," Arabic for "God is great," before launching the attack, wielding a knife and axe. "The perpetrator was able to leave the train, police left in pursuit and as part of this pursuit, they shot the attacker and killed him," a police spokesman said. On Tuesday, Herrmann added that a police special unit happened to be in the area and was able to respond to the incident quickly. Herrmann said four people—all members of the same family from Hong Kong—were injured in the attack. Two of them were in critical condition. 7:21 p.m. Wuerzburg police said three people suffered serious injuries from the attack, while another person was injured less severely. While initial reports said there were more than 20 victims, police say 14 people were treated for shock on the scene. 7:16 p.m. Germany has become a home for many of the refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and other war-torn countries in recent years. In 2015 alone, Germany registered 1.1 million asylum seekers, among them 150,000 Afghans. From January to June of this year, Germany has accepted 220,000 asylum-seekers. The prospect of an Afghan asylum-seeker getting refugee status in German is considerably lower than that of a Syrian, Iraq, or Eritrean.
Facebook is about to begin beaming down Internet access from a solar-powered drone the size of an airliner.

Facebook has built the first of what it hopes will be a large fleet of solar-powered drones to bring Internet connectivity to hundreds of millions of people beyond the reach of today’s telecommunications infrastructure.

Facebook designed and built this carbon-fiber drone, called Aquila, to bring Internet connectivity not served by today’s communications infrastructure.

Aquila, as the V-shaped carbon fiber craft is known, is powered by two propellers and has a wingspan of about 42 meters, roughly equivalent to a Boeing 737 airliner. When covered in solar panels and loaded with communications gear needed to beam down wireless Internet connectivity, it should weigh only a little over 400 kilograms (about 900 pounds), roughly one-third of a Toyota Prius.

Facebook has not yet flown the recently completed craft but has been testing one-tenth scale versions over the U.K. since March. The full-size Aquila is undergoing structural tests and should begin flight tests before the end of this year.

Jay Parikh, Facebook’s vice president of global engineering and infrastructure, introduced Aquila today at an event at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California. He said that roughly 10 percent of the world’s population, mostly in rural areas, can’t get Internet access with existing delivery technologies. Facebook’s drones will change that, he said: “Our mission in the company is to connect everybody in the world.”

Aquila is designed to be hauled up into the stratosphere by a helium balloon, where it cut loose and will fly in five-kilometer circles at altitudes of between 18 and 27 kilometers (60,000 to 90,000 feet), far above commercial flights, clouds, and weather.

Each Aquila drone will carry radio equipment to provide broadband connectivity to satellite receivers inside a roughly 50-mile radius on the ground below. The drones will also carry equipment that can form high-speed connections using laser beams. The idea is that Facebook will create aerial chains with the drones to link several rural areas to the Internet. The drone nearest an urban area would use its laser to hook into the global Internet, and that connectivity would be passed down the line to drones over rural areas using the laser links. In cloudy weather, the ground-to-drone link will be made using radio instead, at some reduction in the data rate.

Facebook says its engineers recently set a new record for the speed at which data can be transferred using lasers, reporting speeds of tens of gigabits per second, which they said was about 10 times better than previous best efforts.

However, Facebook has considerable work to do before its drone scheme catches up with a stratospheric plan from its rival Google. The search and ads company is already testing helium balloons that can deliver wireless broadband to existing mobile handsets (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2015: Project Loon”).

After Facebook gets Aquila off the ground it has to work up to flying it in the stratosphere for about three months at a time for it to be a practical way to deliver Internet connectivity, says Parikh. The longest flight so far is only about two weeks, he says.

Facebook is also behind Google when it comes to figuring out a business model for its drones. Facebook may license or sell its drone technology to companies or governments, but such details remain undecided, Parikh said. “We’re not going to operate this stuff ourselves,” he said.

Google, by contrast, will operate its Loon balloons itself and rent access to them to wireless carriers as a way to extend their coverage. By the end of the year Google plans to have balloons providing continuous coverage for people living along a thin band around the Southern Hemisphere. It has also struck a deal with the government of Sri Lanka to blanket the entire island with balloon-borne Internet coverage.

Mike Cassidy, the leader of Google’s balloon project, has argued that balloons will be cheaper and more practical than drones for some time, due to the technical challenges of inventing and operating them.

Facebook has been working on ways to get more people online since 2013 under a project known as Internet.org. Its main activity has been striking deals with wireless carriers in 17 countries around the world to allow people to use certain online services through a special Facebook app without racking up data fees.

Although Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg has spoken of the project as a humanitarian one, it also has clear benefits to his company because more people online means more potential customers (see “Facebook’s Two Faces”). The Internet.org project has also made Facebook a powerful gatekeeper for Internet access in some countries, leading to a backlash from some Internet users, companies, and governments (see “Facebook’s Internet.org Hits Global Flak” and “Indian Companies Turn Against Facebook’s Scheme for Broader Internet Access”).

Last week was a week of firsts for CNBC International’s social media editor Cristy Garratt. The broadcaster went deeper on its Facebook Live strategy, streaming its daily morning TV show “Street Signs Europe” via the platform for the first time. This wasn’t a matter of just replicating the show on Facebook; ad breaks were ditched in favor of exclusive content and chances to participate for the Facebook audience. Their responses also helped shape the rest of the show.

That made things a little more hectic than usual. Here’s what her Wednesday looked like.

5:00 a.m.: Normally, I’d still be sound asleep, but special occasions like this week’s Facebook Live trial call for an earlier wake-up. The usual morning ritual of rolling out of bed, showering and picking an outfit I hope I won’t hate once I’ve drunk my morning coffee ensues. There’s a morning person deep inside all of us, right?

Advertisement

5:45 a.m.: My cab has arrived. I hop in, greet the driver, then furiously spend the next 30 minutes on my phone. I check emails, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Slack (in that order). I check in on the latest from my colleagues in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, (CNBC’s global HQ) and Singapore to see what content we posted on social media overnight.

6:15 a.m.: Gnaw on a granola bar while trolling the internet for the business news stories trending on social and search. I write these up into an email for our TV and dotcom news teams in Europe and the U.S. to help inform the news agenda for the day.

6:40 a.m.: Head over to hair and makeup. An unusual one for me, as I’m normally safely hidden behind my computer screen. But as I mentioned before, this week is different. I’ll be appearing during the TV ad breaks on our Facebook Live stream to feature the very best of our user comments.

7:00 a.m.: Take a look at the day’s trending stories and the “Street Signs” rundown, then come up with the day’s poll for Facebook Live. Today, we’re having a bit of fun with it, thanks to the viral video of David Cameron humming a little tune after his resignation speech. We’ll be asking viewers what emotions they believe were behind the little song.

7:30 a.m.: Check in with Roxanne Lim, our social media producer in Singapore who has graciously offered to stay late this week to help me out. I let her know the day’s poll and the topics we’ll be touching on. She’ll then approve comments to send our way during the broadcast.

8:00 a.m.: Meet with Squawk Box Europe producer Leonie Kidd and reporter Gemma Acton to solidify plans for our custom segments for Facebook Live. I knew ad breaks could be a big drop-off point for a streaming audience, so we created four alternative Facebook-only segments to fill in the gaps.

8:30 a.m.: It’s almost time! Log into our streaming platform on both my computer and iPad. Write up the text that will be paired with the live. Set our anchor Louisa Bojesen up on Facebook, so she knows where to find viewer comments. Finalize last minute details.

8:59 a.m.: And we’re off! Louisa goes to air a minute early to welcome Facebook viewers to the broadcast. I share the live stream to Twitter and our talent pages.

9:00 a.m.: This is the fun part. I act as the moderator within the comment section, getting viewers to weigh in on what our guests are saying. I send over relevant comments and questions to the “Street Signs” production team so they can integrate them into the show for Louisa. I introduce the poll of the day for viewers and encourage them to vote.



9:15 a.m.: Head over to the camera in our newsroom and have a quick chat with Gemma. Before I know it, we’re live on Facebook, chatting about David Cameron’s humming abilities, our viewer comments and introducing the poll to viewers. This is a unique opportunity to completely focus on our audience for a few minutes, something I think is crucial when transitioning a television product to social media.

9:20 a.m.: Back at the desk and moderating the conversation with our viewers.

9:45 a.m.: It’s time for my second hit with Gemma. This time, we reveal the poll results (they thought David Cameron was humming out of relief, by the way) and chat about Nintendo’s massive increase in share prices thanks to Pokémon Go. Viewers weigh in, saying they wish they’d bought Nintendo shares sooner!

9:50 a.m.: Comment, comment, comment.

10:00 a.m.: We did it! Time to end the live stream, thank viewers for joining us and invite them to chat along with us again tomorrow.

10:15 a.m.: After the show, key players regroup in the svp of international news and programming’s office. Here, we discuss how the show went technically and editorially. One of the most helpful tools we have in this process is Facebook’s new engagement graph, which shows us where we peaked and declined in engagement. This helps us pick out stories viewers seemed particularly engaged with. For example, after good engagement around Pokémon Go in our ad break on Monday, we actually decided to incorporate an entire segment into “Street Signs” on Tuesday. The power of live feedback from your audience!

12:00 p.m.: The U.S. social team starts to trickle into the office, which means I hand over control of the U.S. social media pages back over the pond. Back in Europe, representatives from the different teams across TV and digital gather in the boardroom for a forward planning meeting. This is when I get a good view of what we will be covering the following week, allowing me to pinpoint opportunities for social — whether that means live-tweeting an event, recommending a Snapchat takeover or a Facebook Live.

12:30 p.m.: I quickly pop out of the office to grab some lunch and the “world’s biggest cappuccino, please.”

1:00 p.m.: It’s time for more Facebook and Twitter love, but this is when I also craft an Instagram post, find career-friendly news for LinkedIn and check on our daily post on WeChat.



2:00 p.m.: I hop into the weekly meeting with our Digital Video team. Video has been a critical factor in our young Facebook page’s growth, so I always make sure to attend this one when I can. We review the week’s content — what worked, what didn’t — and I offer my thoughts on future videos. Just like the social media team, digital video exists to help us reach the C-suite of tomorrow, the aspirational audience we’re hoping to build a relationship with online.

3:00 p.m.: Now that the States is waking up, I take this chance to delve into the stats of this morning’s Facebook Live. We’ve found nearly half of our views on lives come after the actual event itself, so it makes sense to check in again a few hours later. I tidy the stats up into a neat email and send them off to key players.

4:00 p.m.: It’s time to start wrapping up the day. I stick on my headphones and jam to some Beyoncé while prepping our evergreen stories for the evening. Before I head out, I let the U.S. team know I’m going so they can cover breaking news until our Asia office gets through the door.

5:00 p.m.: If I haven’t roped myself into some sort of social commitment, I’m out the door and grabbing some dinner to take home. Soft pillow, I’ll be seeing you soon!

In the mid-20th century, the Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen uncovered an odd quirk of animal behavior: Across species, the animals in his experiments seemed to prefer prettier, flashier, more attention-grabbing versions of their natural environments—“supernormal stimuli,” he called them—even when those stimuli were fake. Certain types of fish, he found, would become more violent towards dummy fish whose undersides were more vibrant than the species’ usual color; mother birds would ignore their own eggs to sit on a nest of larger, more colorful imitations, or divert food from their children to feed models of chicks with brighter beaks. “The essence of the supernormal stimulus,” the psychiatrist Deirdre Barrett wrote in her book on the subject, “is that the exaggerated imitation can cause a stronger pull than the real thing.” “We humans can produce our own,” she continued, like “candy sweeter than any fruit,” or pornography.

On its face, the comparison makes sense: People like sugar and people like sex; candy and pornography are both super-concentrated, turbocharged doses of more natural sensory experiences. "The exaggerated imitation can cause a stronger pull than the real thing." On closer examination, though, one of these things is not like the other: The pleasure of sugar is delivered the same way—taste—whether it comes from a strawberry or a piece of strawberry taffy. Pornography, on the other hand, is a different sensory experience than the real thing, relying on sight and sound in place of touch. And between the two is another distinctly human supernormal stimulus: food porn, the carefully arranged, carefully filtered images that show a meal—homecooked or restaurant-served—at its most appealing. Food porn is defined in part by the senses that it is a visual experience of something that other people can smell and taste. Food porn, as Amanda Simpson, the creator of the site Food Porn Daily, told The Daily Meal in 2010, is “anything that makes me drool”—something that, at its best, should manufacture a desire that it can’t satisfy. What’s the appeal in ogling what you can’t have? In the case of food porn, at least, researchers still aren’t sure. * * * The first documented use of the term “food porn” comes from the feminist writer Rosalind Cowards’s 1984 book Female Desire. It was referenced every so often for the next two decades or so by food writers and chefs, according to the site Know Your Meme, but didn’t take on its current meaning—food photos shared through social media—until the early 2000s. The photo-sharing website Flickr launched a “Food Porn” category in September 2004 (today, it has around three-quarters of a million photos). And a few months later, in April 2005, it entered the Urban Dictionary lexicon. Definition: “Close-up images of juicy, delicious food in advertisements.” Used in a sentence: Oh, that McDonalds ad was like food porn. I want a Big Mac sooo bad. Seemingly minute details about a dish's appearance, like shape, can alter diners' perception of its taste. Urban Dictionary, though, makes an assumption on something that research hasn’t yet been able to prove. A McDonalds ad for a Big Mac may look delicious, but what’s still murky is whether that necessarily translates into hunger for a Big Mac.

The chef’s maxim that people first eat with their eyes is backed both by common sense—food stylists exist for a reason, and a glistening grill-marked burger that oozes cheese is an easier sell than a limp, gray one—and by science. A 2012 study published in the journal Physiology and Behavior, for example, found that seemingly minute details about a dish’s appearance, like “gloss, evenness, and shape,” can alter how diners perceive its taste and smell. But what happens when eating with the eyes is the only step, rather than just the first—when the image isn’t a bridge to smelling and tasting a dish, but the entire experience? Some scientists believe—like Simpson—that images of food only trigger the desire for the real thing. A 2012 study, for example, found that just looking at pictures of food may be enough to cause an uptick in ghrelin, a hormone that causes hunger. One reason may be that looking primes the brain for eating. “If you think about throwing a baseball, your brain reacts like you’re really throwing a baseball,” explained Gabriella Petrick, a professor of nutrition and food studies at George Mason University. “When we eat things, different parts of our brain light up in different ways. It’s not just taste—we evoke sight, we evoke hearing, we evoke lots of different [things] as our brain tries to construct what our food is.” But other research has shown that when it comes to appetite, food porn may be a substitute for food itself. One 2011 study found that looking at pictures of food may turn people off from the real thing—but only if the food in the image has a similar flavor to whatever real item is about to be consumed. When volunteers viewed photos of salty snacks and then ate salted peanuts, they tended to enjoy the nuts less than people who had viewed photos of desserts. Related Story Food: The Newest Celebrity And in 2013 study in mice published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, when researchers flooded the reward centers of the rodents’ brains with insulin, a hormone that triggers feelings of fullness, the mice lost interest in returning to places where they had previously been given food—suggesting, the authors said, that the brain’s reward centers may not respond as much to “food cues”—a feeding area for mice, a photo for humans—when the brain knows that the stomach is full. Taken in sum, the research, with all its contradictions, doesn’t reveal much. And ideas about why people take so much pleasure in sharing their food-porn images are as varied as theories about why people view them.

If you’re reading this, it happened again. Right now, an editor may be about to issue an apology or a stern rebuttal. Someone’s reputation and body of work is being scrutinized. And a gaggle of self-appointed fact-checkers may be plugging sentence after sentence into Google for any traces of dishonesty. If you’re reading this, a journalist has been accused of what Poynter's Roy Peter Clark calls “the unoriginal sin": plagiarism.

Plagiarism is a serious charge. If true, it has the potential to upend a career and mar a journalist’s reputation for life. And yet, in today’s world of aggregated news, plagiarism is an imprecise word that stands for a spectrum of offenses related to unoriginal work. And its severity varies dramatically depending on a variety of circumstances.

See also: Welcome to post-plagiarism America

So before you jump on Twitter to excoriate or defend the media's latest alleged idea thief, take a minute to go over the following checklist to determine for yourself whether the charges are true. Also, you can cut out or take a screen shot of our plagiarism flowchart for editors.

Is some of the language in the article unoriginal? Is the central idea of the story unoriginal?

In his 2007 dissertation on plagiarism in newspapers, Norman Lewis put forth the following definition of plagiarism: “Using someone else’s words or original ideas without attribution.” This definition, he says, focuses on the act of plagiarism itself and disregards questions of intent. Whether or not the journalist meant to plagiarize is a question best reserved for determining the severity of the crime, not for establishing whether it happened. Did the author fail to set off unoriginal language or ideas with quotation marks?

Attribution is the opposite of plagiarism, Lewis says, and the clearest indicator of attribution is quotation marks, followed by a citation. The National Summit to Fight Plagiarism and Fabrication put it this way: “Principled professionals credit the work of others, treating others as they would like to be treated themselves.” Does the author fail to attribute the work in some other way, such as a paraphrase with credit?

Without proper credit, a paraphrase can be used to conceal plagiarism. As Lewis writes, “treating paraphrasing as a plagiarism panacea ignores the fact that a person who cribs from someone else’s work is still cribbing, even if he or she is adept at rewording.” Did the author lift more than seven words verbatim from another source?

For editors and readers trying to evaluate cases of plagiarism, the 7 to 10-word threshold is a useful guideline, said Kelly McBride, Poynter’s vice president of academic programs. The basic idea is that it’s hard to incidentally replicate seven consecutive words that appear in another author’s work. This is not an absolute rule, however — both McBride and Lewis acknowledge that there’s no easy equation to determine what constitutes plagiarism.

If you answered ‘yes’ to all the questions above, then the accusations being hurled around on Twitter are at least partially right; there’s a legitimate case of unoriginal work masquerading as fresh content. But before you call it plagiarism, remember that there might be a more nuanced word for what’s being discussed. Plagiarism.org lists 10 types of thievery, each with their own degrees of severity, and iThenticate, a plagiarism detection service, lists five additional kinds of lifting in its summary on plagiarism in research.

Here’s a sampling of some unoriginal writing you might run into:

Self-plagiarism:

The outing of Jonah Lehrer, one of the most prominent self-plagiarizers in recent memory, touched off a vigorous debate about whether writers who recycle their own work without acknowledging its unoriginality are guilty of plagiarism or some lesser charge. Poynter vice president and senior scholar Roy Peter Clark, along with New York Times standards editor Phil Corbett says "self-plagiarism" should be called something else; writing before the Lehrer incident, Lewis said self-plagiarism was “less an ethical infraction than a potential violation of ownership rights.” McBride likened Lehrer’s duplicitous duplications to a boyfriend who “recycles the same seemingly spontaneous romantic moments on a succession of dates.” Reuters media critic Jack Shafer argues that you can’t steal from yourself.

Patchwriting:

If the author didn’t copy verbatim, he or she may be guilty of intellectual dishonesty — even if they credit the source. Journalists who craft paraphrases that mirror their source material with the exception of a few jumbled-up words are perpetrators of “patchwriting,” which McBride defines as “relying too heavily on the vocabulary and syntax of the source material.” Clark argues that this is a lesser charge than plagiarism if a writer credits their source. McBride has called it “just as dishonest” as plagiarism.

Excessive aggregation:

Rewriting an entire article, even with proper credit (or an obligatory h/t), is a form of appropriation. Plagiarism.org lists aggregation without original ideas as one of the least severe forms of plagiarism because it does not deceive readers about the source of the information. A sure way to avoid excessive aggregation is to transform the original work by adding value to it, McBride said.

Idea theft:

Relying too heavily on another journalist's original story ideas and concepts is "quite common in journalism and not intellectually honest," McBride said. This can occur when a reporter sets out to "match" a story by interviewing the same sources without acknowledging the news was first reported elsewhere.

Shortly after Melania Trump finished her address Monday night to the Republican National Convention, CNN's Anderson Cooper turned to analyst David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Obama, and noted a similarity between Trump's speech and the one Michelle Obama delivered to the Democratic convention in 2008 — the prime-time slot on opening night.

"Just the same spot in 2008," Axelrod reiterated.

He went on to recall a few details about Obama's remarks: "She could speak about [Barack Obama] in a way and with an intimacy that no one else could, and she did it, I have to say — I'm biased in this regard — but I think that she did it very, very movingly because she did use more personal stories about him and his story. ... And, you know, Michelle Obama — she had her speech written also four, five weeks in advance, and she practiced, and she practiced, and she practiced."

Melania Trump's speech at the GOP convention in Cleveland is drawing comparisons to Michelle Obama's speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. Here's a side-by-side look at both. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)

As well as Axelrod seemed to remember Obama's speech, he apparently didn't notice that Trump had repeated some of her lines. In fact, the journalist widely credited as the first to document the apparent plagiarism, Jarrett Hill, wasn't at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland and wasn't even assigned to cover the convention at all. He was 2,000 miles away at a coffee shop in Los Angeles.

CORRECTION: Melania stole a whole graph from Michelle's speech. #GOPConvention

WATCH: https://t.co/8BCOwXAHSy pic.twitter.com/zudpDznGng — Jarrett Hill (@JarrettHill) July 19, 2016

The New York Times caught up with Hill, who described his discovery.

Mr. Hill, a television journalist who was recently laid off, said in an interview that one of Ms. Trump's lines — the words "strength of your dreams" — caught his attention as he was watching on his computer from a Starbucks in Los Angeles, juggling Facebook chats and browsing Twitter. Mr. Hill, 31, found the clip of Mrs. Obama's speech online and noticed that parts of the two speeches sounded the same. He then realized that a larger portion appeared to have been borrowed as he continued to examine both. "I thought, 'That's legit plagiarism,'" said Mr. Hill, who described himself as a supporter of President Obama. "'Someone took this piece and plugged in their own information.'"

The Trump campaign has cycled through various denials and explanations for the, um, overlap between the speeches given by Melania Trump and Michelle Obama. Perhaps the best so far came from campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, speaking to the Hill: "This concept that Michelle Obama invented the English language is absurd."

Got it.

What's clear is that whoever wrote/copy-pasted Trump's speech figured the journalists covering the convention wouldn't notice. That turned out to be true. But the aide responsible for the speech didn't account for the out-of-work reporter in an L.A. Starbucks.

UPDATE: Queen has once again spoken out against Donald Trump and the Republican party after Trump walked onstage at the Republican National Convention Monday night to the band's "We Are the Champions." "An unauthorised use at the Republican Convention against our wishes," the band wrote on Twitter.

On Tuesday, after clinching the final round of Republican primaries, Donald Trump walked onstage for his victory speech to Queen's triumphant anthem "We Are the Champions." Queen guitarist Brian May has issued a stern statement denouncing the usage of the song.

"I've had an avalanche of complaints – some of which you can see in our 'Letters' page – about Donald Trump using our 'We Are The Champions' track as his 'theme' song on USA TV," May wrote on his website. "This is not an official Queen statement, but I can confirm that permission to use the track was neither sought nor given. We are taking advice on what steps we can take to ensure this use does not continue. Regardless of our views on Mr. Trump's platform, it has always been against our policy to allow Queen music to be used as a political campaigning tool."

In the aforementioned "Letters" section of his site, May responded to a fan message pointing out the usage. "We certainly have not approved this use of ['We Are the Champions]," the musician responded. "I will make sure we take what steps we can to dissociate ourselves from Donald Trump's unsavoury campaign."

May isn't the first musician to deny Trump access to their catalogs. In September, after the politician used R.E.M.'s hit "It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" at a rally, singer Michael Stipe angrily responded, "Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you – you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men ... Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign."
"Roger is at work. The review is ongoing. And the only agreement that is in place is his existing employment agreement," says a representative for parent company 21st Century Fox amid reports the news mogul is on his way out.

Roger Ailes will step down as chairman and CEO of Fox News, according to a since-deleted tweet on Tuesday from influential conservative media commentator Matt Drudge that included an exit document.

Drudge, who posted what appears to be the separation agreement between Ailes and Fox News, took it down minutes after posting the document. The final day for the exec, who has been embroiled in a sexual harassment investigation by Fox News parent 21st Century Fox, is dated July 22.

Asked to confirm Ailes' exit, a Fox News spokesperson declined to comment, but a rep for 21st Century Fox says, "Roger is at work. The review is ongoing. And the only agreement that is in place is his existing employment agreement."

In addition, media outlets are being provided a statement from Ailes lawyer Susan Estrich, responding to a report Tuesday claiming Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly had told investigators she was harassed by Ailes.

"Roger Ailes has never sexually harassed Megyn Kelly," Estrich says in the statement. "In fact, he has spent much of the last decade promoting and helping her to achieve the stardom she earned, for which she has repeatedly and publicly thanked him."

In what could foreshadow a shake-up for the cabler, anchors Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren have contracts structured so that they could exit the network if Ailes does, The Financial Times reported, citing unnamed sources.

The unfolding drama comes just weeks after ousted anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes, prompting an internal review and cascading media reports (many from women who declined to be identified) asserting similar claims. Since Carlson's suit was filed in New Jersey Superior Court (Ailes has a home in New Jersey), many prominent Fox News anchors have come forward to support Ailes including Van Susteren, Maria Bartiromo, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Martha MacCallum, Sandra Smith and Jeanine Pirro, a former New York prosecutor.

"Everyone I know at Fox News was shocked," MacCallum told The Hollywood Reporter on July 10.

Kelly, the network's biggest female star, whose rankling of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump became a central storyline in the volatile 2016 race, has stayed silent. But on July 19, New York magazine reported Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her when she first joined the network as a legal correspondent. Kelly is currently in contract negotiations. But she has said publicly that she's unsure if she wants to stay at Fox News.

"Loyal" and "supportive" are adjectives many Fox News employees have used to describe Ailes over the years.

"You don't feel that your neck is on some chopping block, and if you have a weak period in the ratings or if you say something stupid you're going to get fired," Kelly told THR during a 2015 interview about Ailes. "You're not going to get fired. It would have to be really, really egregious. The people who get fired at Fox, it's never really a firing, it's usually, 'Well, it didn't work out so let me help you move on and I won't publicly humiliate you.'

Ailes has always had a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch, who shares some of Ailes' conservative ideology and hired Ailes to execute a vision for a different kind of cable news channel. But Ailes has not forged a relationship with Murdoch's sons, James and Lachlan Murdoch, who in 2015 took over day-to-day oversight of 21st Century Fox. The new hierarchy has been a sore spot for Ailes. And as the internal review — conducted by New York law firm Paul Weiss — progressed, James and Lachlan Murdoch are said to have moved to oust Ailes.

If he is indeed out, it would be a stunning fall for one of the most prominent figures in modern media and a force in conservative politics since the Nixon administration. Since he created Fox News Channel in 1996, Ailes has run his empire with an iron fist and creative flair that has earned him a singular place in the media firmament. His model of presenting an alternative, conservative voice amidst what he views as the liberal monolith of mainstream media has made Fox News the No. 1 cable news network for more than a decade, generating more than $2 billion annually and the biggest revenue driver in the 21st Century Fox portfolio.

When asked in a 2015 interview with THR if he has imagined a life after Fox News, Ailes answered: "No, no. What would I do?"
A Syrian family has been housed in an empty property in the grounds of Lambeth Palace, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has confirmed, as he and the Home Office launched a scheme to encourage members of the public, community groups, faith groups, charities and businesses to sponsor refugee families resettling in the UK.

The full community sponsorship scheme is intended to help the government fulfil its commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in the UK before 2020. About 1,800 refugees have been resettled so far, less than 10% of the total.

Over the past year there have been numerous ad hoc and sometimes chaotic efforts by community groups and members of the public to provide aid to refugees waiting to come to the UK. Donations of food, clothing, books and household goods, plus offers of accommodation in spare rooms, have overwhelmed social action groups.

Launching the scheme at Lambeth Palace, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: “The response of the British public to the refugee crisis has been one of overwhelming generosity and many have been moved to make kind offers of assistance.”

She said the sponsorship scheme was “a groundbreaking development for resettlement in the UK and I wholeheartedly encourage organisations that can help to offer their support”.

Asked why it had taken 10 months for the Home Office to establish a scheme whereby offers to help refugees could be taken up, Rudd said: “We have to be absolutely clear that we’re doing everything correctly and safely. This is about families, about children – and however much we want to move quickly, we can’t compromise safety at any point.

“We have now the structure and the architecture for trying to channel people’s extraordinary goodwill, wanting to help people … I hope we’ll see a great stepping forward and acceleration of this so we can actually deliver on it. But it was right to take the time to get it right.”

Welby said there had been “no sense of delay from the Home Office or the government”. Special care needed to be taken with families who had had traumatic experiences. “It’s got to be got right at the beginning or you open your way to further tragedy in the future,” he said.

Sponsoring organisations must have the agreement of local authorities and set out a comprehensive plan for settlement in order to apply to join the scheme. Sponsors will provide housing, help refugees access medical and social services, arrange English tuition and support refugees in finding work.

A “help refugees in the UK” page on the gov.uk website will allow members of the public to offer support. People will be able to choose from a range of donation options, including clothing, baby equipment, outings and the use of vacant housing, which must be self-contained and available for at least 12 months.

Rudd said that careful checks were carried out on refugees who could be resettled by the UN and the government. “I hope that we’ll be able to reassure people who are kind enough to open up their houses and to raise funds in their communities that we won’t take any risk with security, and those checks will keep people safe.”

Lambeth Palace, Welby’s home and his administrative headquarters as archbishop of Canterbury, is the first community group to be approved to receive a refugee family. Welby first offered a cottage in the grounds of Lambeth Palace as a home for a family from Syria last September.

“It is an enormous privilege to welcome a family to live in a cottage in the grounds of Lambeth Palace,” he said. The scheme “presents churches and other civil society groups with the opportunity to provide sanctuary to those fleeing war-torn places”, he added.

Rudd, who met the family on Tuesday, said all four children, aged between four and 10, told her they wanted to be doctors. She said: “That will be a great help to our national health service in some years to come, to have four new budding doctors. I’m really moved by the experience of meeting them and hearing from them firsthand about what a really important and exciting change it is for them.”

Welby said it had been a lot of work to reach this stage, but it had been an extraordinary partnership with the Home Office and Lambeth council. He added: “It’s a great privilege to be involved with this.” Lambeth Palace declined to give any further details about the family.

The Refugee Council chief executive, Maurice Wren, welcomed the announcement, saying: “This scheme helps harness the eagerness and determination of the public to welcome refugees into their communities. Hopefully, it can also become a way for more refugees of all nationalities to reach the UK safely and legally in the future.”

But he added: “It must be complemented by a much wider, compassionate and comprehensive response from the government to addressing the global refugee crisis which prioritises giving more refugees safe passage here, particularly those who are desperate to join their loved ones.”

Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, said: “This innovative scheme will enable everyone to get involved with welcoming refugees, offering a very real and tangible way for people to help new arrivals settle into their communities.”

The government has agreed to take up to 3,000 vulnerable children and their relatives directly from refugee camps in the Middle East and north Africa, on top of the 20,000 refugees under the vulnerable persons resettlement (VPR) scheme.

More than 160 local authorities have signed up to accept refugees.


“A safe and effective HIV vaccine is essential to reach a timely, sustained end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,” said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. “The launch of HVTN 100 marks an important step forward in building upon the promising results of the RV144 trial to produce an HIV vaccine that could have a significant public health impact in southern Africa, where the HIV/AIDS pandemic is most

pervasive.”

NIAID holds responsibility for all operational aspects of the Phase I/II trial, which has a target enrollment of 252 HIV-uninfected heterosexual adults ages 18 to 40. NIAID and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are co-funding the study along with the South African Medical Research Council, and the NIAID-funded HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is conducting the trial. Sanofi Pasteur and Novartis Vaccines manufactured the test vaccines for the study.



The HVTN 100 study is part of a larger HIV vaccine research endeavor led by a group called the Pox-Protein Public-Private Partnership, or the P5—a diverse set of public and private organizations, including NIAID, committed to building on the success of RV144. The P5 aims to produce an HIV vaccine that could have a significant public health benefit in southern Africa and to deepen scientists’ understanding of the immune responses associated with preventing HIV infection.



The HVTN 100 trial is being led by protocol chair Linda-Gail Bekker, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the University of Cape Town and chief operating officer of the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation in South Africa. Protocol co-chair Fatima Laher, M.D., director of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa, is also heading the trial.



“Our country is helping lead the way in HIV prevention research," said Glenda Gray, MBBCH, FCPaeds (SA), president of the South African Medical Research Council and HVTN co-principal investigator. "A safe and effective vaccine is our best hope for stopping new HIV infections and protecting the health of our communities.”

The experimental vaccine regimen tested in the RV144 trial was found to be 31.2 percent effective at preventing HIV infection 3.5 years after vaccination, although it appears to have been 60 percent effective one year after vaccination. In the HVTN 100 study, the design and schedule of the RV144 vaccine regimen have been altered to try to increase the magnitude and duration of vaccine-elicited immune responses.



“HVTN 100 builds on the clues we ascertained from RV144 suggesting we could make the vaccine protection stronger and more durable,” said Dr. Bekker. “The clinical research will tell us if our hypotheses are correct.”

The HVTN 100 vaccine regimen consists of two experimental vaccines: a canarypox-based vaccine called ALVAC-HIV and a gp120 protein subunit vaccine with an adjuvant that enhances the body's immune response. Both ALVAC-HIV (supplied by Sanofi Pasteur) and the protein vaccine (supplied by Novartis Vaccines) have been modified from RV144 to be specific to HIV subtype C, the predominant HIV subtype in southern Africa. In addition, the protein vaccine in HVTN 100 is using a different adjuvant than did RV144 in the hope of generating a more robust immune response. Finally, the HVTN 100 vaccine regimen will include booster shots at the one-year mark in an effort to prolong the early protective effect observed in RV144.

All study participants will receive a total of eight injections over the course of a year. The volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive either the investigational vaccine regimen (210 participants) or a placebo (42 participants).



The safety of HVTN 100 study participants will be closely monitored throughout the trial. In addition, the HVTN 100 study team will routinely counsel study participants on ways to protect themselves from HIV infection.



The P5 is overseeing two separate but related HIV vaccine research programs in southern Africa. The Development Track, of which HVTN 100 is a part, aims to license a subtype C HIV vaccine regimen similar to the one studied in RV144. The Research Track will study new pox-protein vaccine regimens with a variety of adjuvants as part of the search for next-generation HIV vaccine candidates.



“It has been a long road to reach this point,” said Dr. Laher. “People in the South African communities where HVTN 100 will take place are excited that this is a critical trial on the path toward finding a safe and effective HIV vaccine.”

In the end, elections usually come back to the economy—to jobs, wages, taxes, imports and exports, the price of goods and the cost of an education. Differences over all these issues—from tax rates and immigration to globalization and the minimum wage—are particularly sharp this year between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Here’s a look at where the two candidates stand on the top economic issues.

Embed Louisiana's Top Cop: Officers Were 'Targeted and Assassinated' 0:23 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

The former Marine who killed three Louisiana law enforcement officers and wounded three others Sunday stalked his targets with military-like precision, looking past citizens as he moved through a commercial strip seeking more cops to shoot, authorities said.

The gunman, a 29-year-old Missouri man named Gavin Long, traveled to Baton Rouge a few days before the attack and clearly wanted to kill police officers, authorities said Monday.

The city has been riven by protests since the July 5 police killing of Alton Sterling, but authorities said they were not sure whether Long was inspired by that event — or a gunman's deadly ambush of police officers in Dallas last week.

The attacks have inflamed a furious debate about police use of force and the lost of public trust.

"Clearly the landscape has changed since Dallas," Louisiana State Police Col. Michael Edmonson said in an afternoon news conference.

Long's assault came a few days after police foiled an alleged homegrown plot to kill local police officers, and has raised fears of more such violence.

Gov. John Bel Edwards called Long's rampage "diabolical," and said that he attacked "the very fabric of our society. And that is not what justice looks like. It's not justice for Alton Sterling or anything else that's ever happened in this state or anywhere else. It's not justice for anybody. It's certainly not constructive. It's just pure unadulterated evil."

Now the state needs to "start a conversation," Edwards said, "so that we can find out together where we go from here."

Embed Gov. Edwards: Baton Rouge Police Ambush Is Not Justice 0:55 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

Edmonson, along with East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux III, used maps to show reporters how Long moved around the shopping complex on Airline Highway, on the city's southeastern edge, seeking cops to kill.

"His intentions were accurate and they were engaging and they were all aimed at police officers," Edmonson said.

The police commanders said they pieced together the ambush, which lasted less than 10 minutes, with help from surveillance video.

Baton Rouge Police Press conference, July 18, 2016 NBC News

It began around 8:40 a.m. CT, after Long got out of his rental car, a Chevrolet Malibu, with a semi-automatic 5.56 caliber rifle and a 9 mm pistol, Edmonson said. On foot and by car, he began to stalk a complex that included a gym, a car wash, a beauty salon and a Party City. Stills from the videos show Long dressed all in black, with a military-style pants, a short-sleeve shirt and a hooded mask.

First, Long approached the car of a sheriff's deputy who works security in the area, but it turned out to be empty, Edmonson said. Long also noticed a police officer washing his car, who left by the time Long got close.

By then, authorities believe, someone had called 911 about "a dude with a rifle."

Among the first to arrive were two Baton Rouge police officers, Montrell Jackson and Matthew Gerald, and East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Deputy Brad Garafola. Long fired on them, killing one of the officers and wounding the other, Edmonson said. Garafola took shelter at a Dumpster behind the beauty shop, then noticed the wounded officer, and went to help him. Long approached Garofola, shot him dead, then killed the wounded officer.

"My deputy went down fighting. He returned fire to the very end, " Gautreaux said.

Then Long moved to another part of the commercial strip, where more officers were arriving. He shot another sheriff's deputy as he sat in his car, hitting him in the head and torso, Gautreaux said. He also shot a third deputy in the arm.

At that point, the city's SWAT team had arrived. One of the members took aim from about 100 yards away and shot Long dead, Edmonson said.

The siege was over by about 8:48 a.m.

A second 5.56-caliber rifle was found in the Malibu, police said.

The most seriously injured deputy, Nicholas Tullier, is fighting for his life, Gautreaux said, while the other injured deputy, Bruce Simmons, is in serious condition.

Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie, Jr. grew visibly emotional as he spoke of his department's, and his city's pain. Behind him, Edwards began to cry.

Debadie also cited his SWAT team's response as justification for what he said critics have called "militarized tactics." If Long hadn't been shot by the city sniper, then Long would have gone to police headquarters to kill more officers, he said.

Such firepower is necessary "because we are up against a force that isn't playing by the rules," Debadie said. "They didn't play by the rules in Dallas, and they didn't play by the rules here."
Now that Britain has voted to leave the European Union, the UK Prime Minister will have to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, thus starting the formal process of a UK exit.

What is Article 50?

Article 50 of the Treaty allows a member state to notify the EU of its withdrawal and obliges the EU to try to negotiate a ‘withdrawal agreement’ with that state. It involves five points:

1.

Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. 2.

A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. 3.

The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period. 4.

For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it. A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 5. If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.

I will take about two years to officially “leave” the EU, however, most experts predict a longer period. During this negotiation process, EU laws will still apply to the UK – it will continue to participate in other EU business but will not participate in internal EU discussions or decisions on its own withdrawal.

Talks will focus on negotiating access to the single market and creating new trade deals, as well as deciding the rights of movement for EU nationals and Britons. For example, what arrangements and visas will be necessary for EU citizens in the UK and for British nationals on the European Continent?

This is also when it will be decided what kind of trade deal Britain will have with the EU. Negotiators must take into account an exiting country’s “future relationship” with the EU.

Agreements or any extension to Article 50 will have to be approved by all 27 member states and will likely require ratification by national parliaments.

British PM David Cameron has said that Article 50 will not be invoked before his successor is in place. He is expected to be replaced by October of 2016.

Investigators found a hand-painted ISIS flag in the room of the 17-year-old asylum seeker who wounded four in an ax attack on a German train, an official said Tuesday.

The incident Monday night took place on a train near Wuerzburg-Heidingsfeld, about 70 miles southeast of Frankfurt. The Afghan teen was shot dead by a SWAT-style team after the attack.

Bavaria's interior minister Joachim Herrmann said the teen — who came to Germany over a year ago as an unaccompanied minor and had lived with a foster family for about two weeks — appeared to have acted alone.

He told a press conference that the handpainted ISIS flag was found in the teen's room along with texts discussing the life of Muslims and how they "have to stand up and fight." A note found also suggested the teen may have written a farewell letter, Herrmann added.

The ISIS-affiliated Amaq Agency released a video that it claims showed the attacker saying he was about to carry out a "martyrdom operation in Germany." A statement from the agency did not indicate whether ISIS had any role in directing or organizing the attack.

Herrmann, however, said the motive for the attack still needed to be investigated and that authorities were trying to find out more about about the suspect's background and route to Germany.

"I cannot say if this is the result of a network," he told the press conference.

Earlier, Herrmann told ZDF Television that investigators were looking into reports the attacker shouted "Allahu akbar" — "God is great" — during the rampage.

Four Hong Kong citizens were among the injured, according to the Hong Kong immigration department. Two of the injuries were reportedly serious.

Between 10 and 20 people sustained light injuries — but the majority of those were suffering from shock, police said Monday.

Monday's attack comes days after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in Nice, France, at the end of a Bastille Day fireworks show, killing 84 people. Authorities in France have called that attack an act of terrorism.

In Germany in May, a man armed with a knife killed one person and injured three others in a dawn attack on a train station near Munich. The attacker in that case was arrested.

Germany last year registered more than 1 million asylum seekers entering the country, including more than 150,000 Afghans.
What are the benefits of paying Talking Points Memo $50 a year (or $5 a month) for a TPM Prime subscription? You get perks like a premium layout and a members-only discussion forum, but most important is probably the warm, fuzzy feeling of supporting independent journalism — and reducing its reliance on the unstable world of digital ad revenue.

Since introducing TPM Prime back in 2012, Talking Points Memo has convinced roughly 11,000 readers to deepen their relationship with the brand by opening their wallets. Many have been compelled by those perks, which TPM has slowly expanded in number, Amazon Prime-style, over the past few years. But many just want to help support the site and see in-depth longform journalism get produced — even if they don’t manage to read all of it.

The latest addition to the package is The Arch, a new magazine offered offered exclusively to TPM subscribers. Talking Points Memo is rolling out The Arch in phases, starting with an in-depth piece on the history of the AR-15 . While these kind of more ambitious pieces aren’t new to TPM Prime, the success of the product over the past few years has made it possible for Talking Points Memo to pour more resources into the effort, said Josh Marshall, TPM’s founder, editor-in-chief, and publisher.

“People like to read longform writing about topics they’re interested in, but they also just like that it exists,” he said. “Readers know all of the stresses that the news and publishing industry are facing and they know how these pressures are leading publishers away from going really deep on fascinating or very important topics. So when they see it being done, they’re excited by it.”

The Arch is the first of a handful of new additions to Prime that TPM plans to add over the next few months. Marshall said that the site’s goal is to end the year with a subscriber base approaching 20,000.

I talked to Marshall about the evolution of the TPM model, the stabilizing power of subscription revenue, and why the key to running a media business today might be to embrace suffering. A lightly edited transcript of the conversation below.

Ricardo Bilton: You announced TPM Prime almost four years ago. How has it changed since then?

Josh Marshall: The broader change we’re making, which I’d say is more of an evolution, is that our whole focus as an organization now is on building a tighter connection with our core readers and creating a tighter fit between the publication those core readers. Obviously as a site, our core readership is only a small fraction of the overall readership that we have every month, but it’s particularly key to us. It’s our base. : The broader change we’re making, which I’d say is more of an evolution, is that our whole focus as an organization now is on building a tighter connection with our core readers and creating a tighter fit between the publication those core readers. Obviously as a site, our core readership is only a small fraction of the overall readership that we have every month, but it’s particularly key to us. It’s our base. Our whole thinking is based on the premise that scale is greatly overrated, which is not a totally unique thought these days. That premise has been the one we’ve been working on since 2012, and it’s shaped all of our business strategies. We’re finding ways to build revenue streams that are based on what’s unique about our core audience and brand and letting other publications that are focused on scale and social media propagation do their own thing. We have a very different strategy.

Bilton: You : You wrote last year that one of the big challenges for media companies, especially newspapers, is that they’ve gone from a model based on the competitive advantages of local monopolies to one where there is more intense competition. Differentiation and leaning in on what makes your audience and brand unique is a lot more important now. How core is that thinking to what you’re doing with TPM Prime?

Marshall: It’s is a big part of Prime, but it’s also core to our ad sales and overall editorial strategies as well. There are obviously sites like HuffPo and BuzzFeed that are doing great, but they’re also driven by huge amounts of venture capital and predicated on what may be a shaky foundation with their reliances on certain social networks and changes in the ad industry. Basically, in today’s ecosystem, uniqueness is the substitute for geographical monopolies.

Bilton: TPM Prime is a subscription product with a variety of perks, including a members-only discussion and ad-free mobile site. What is the thing that ties all of those features together?

Marshall: They are going to be deeper dives into things that are core to TPM, whether that’s longform articles, conversation areas, podcasts, stuff like that. The public TPM model is our iterative, very fast-paced running with the news through the day. That’s something we had a role in pioneering in the online space and something that is part of the basic DNA of what we do. It’s also by its nature very ephemeral, since it’s so fast-paced. Everything that is part of Prime is deeper dives into the topics were interested in and the conversations we want to be having.

Bilton: From what you can tell, which features are resonating most with subscribers?

Marshall: A big chunk of it is that people want to be connected with and support a publication they love. That is always a core part of it. Over time, fewer ads and having a cleaner, less cluttered version of the site has been a really big attraction. That’s also something that tends to hold people. For instance, once you go to your favorite site with a lot fewer ads, which is obviously something we make possible because of the membership fees, you don’t want to go back. That has been a growing part of it. : A big chunk of it is that people want to be connected with and support a publication they love. That is always a core part of it.

It’s a small portion of them, but there’s a certain number of people where that is the entire thing because they’re just RSS fanatics. For other subscribers, its all about The Hive, our community product.

Bilton: But it’s also about creating things that are unique to the paid product.

Marshall: That was for me the original premise of Prime. We have a core readership, but before Prime and other changes we made over the last few years, our business model wasn’t aligned with that core readership. So there were things we knew that our core readership might like, but they weren’t really the things we could do at scale because of the publishing economics. One of my initial thoughts for TPM Prime was that it should become a vehicle where those things became economical to create.

Bilton: So where does the core daily coverage fit within this? How do you think about pushing some of your regular readership to subscribe?

Marshall: For us, there are different parts of the model. I think its possible that we could totally paywall TPM and be a more profitable business by doing exactly what were doing right now but not let people read anything unless they’re a member. But we wouldn’t do that, even if it would make a more profitable company, because the whole reason we do this is we want to have our coverage be out there and hitting, in relative terms, a big audience and affecting news cycles. : For us, there are different parts of the model.

But we wouldn’t do that, even if it would make a more profitable company, because the whole reason we do this is we want to have our coverage be out there and hitting, in relative terms, a big audience and affecting news cycles. Obviously a big part of our business model is — and we do not anticipate this ever changing — is still based on a mass audience and advertising. This allows us to do both things that are key financially and key editorially.

Bilton: When publishers talk about getting revenue directly from readers there seems to be a tendency to make the value proposition about access. As in: If you want to read this article, or have unlimited access to article archives, you’re going to have to pay for access to it. How sustainable is that approach in the long term vs. the TPM Prime strategy, which seems more built on support and deepening relationships?

Marshall: I think that for a publication like TPM, it has to be both. You have to create a strong relationship with readers, but you also need to provide additional things that would give them more reason to pay. It just depends on the things you provide. : I think that for a publication like TPM, it has to be both. You have to create a strong relationship with readers, but you also need to provide additional things that would give them more reason to pay. It just depends on the things you provide. Fundamentally, 99 percent of what people see now, the daily stuff we put out every day, we plan for that to always be available to the public. But if you are someone who comes like half a dozen times a day — and we have a lot of those people — it’s going to be a much more pleasant experience if, for example, there is only one or two ads on every page.

Bilton: Running a media company is hard today, not just because of the existing business challenges, but because it’s not clear which current business models will be sustainable in the long run. From your perspective, what’s been the hardest part?

Marshall: The newspaper industry was dynamic but fairly stable in technological and editorial terms for 60 or 70 years. Yes, it was different in the ’80s than it was in the ’30s, but fundamentally, it was the same. From the very beginning, we realized that there is no platform stability ever in this business and that being in it requires a comfort with constant change on every front. It’s like the Buddhist thing: Once you realize that life is suffering, you achieve transcendence. And once you realize and accept that there is constant change and no stability in the news publishing industry, you realize that there is a better way to go about things.

Bilton: Yeah, change is constant, but I’d imagine you’d also need some stability as well.

Marshall: Having a mission helps with that. TPM is fundamentally an editorial publication. It didn’t come into existence as an investment. It’s a for-profit company — it makes money — but that’s not its reason to exist. We have a certain set of values and approaches that we take with stories we’re interested in and people we want to work with. And that has anchored us over time in a way that has been very powerful for us as an organization. It keeps us focused. We’ve looked for an evolving set of ways to allow us to do what we want to do. Our mission has been a lodestar for us, even as everything around us has changed.

Bilton: Subscriptions help with that as well, right? Beyond revenue, having that kind of model also stabilizes you because it gives you a general idea of what your revenue will look like next year. : Subscriptions help with that as well, right? Beyond revenue, having that kind of model also stabilizes you because it gives you a general idea of what your revenue will look like next year. Marshall: That’s exactly right. Again, our ad sales model is a mirror of TPM Prime in that it is very focused on a particular audience we have and selling in a space where we know there is a certain kind of a demand for a certain kind of unique audience. All of that creates stability. If Facebook changes some algorithm, or suddenly everyone is interested in this new kind of bell and whistle, that’s not going to throw us as much as it’s going to throw others. Bilton: The advertising climate right now makes that even harder. : The advertising climate right now makes that even harder.

Marshall: A huge amount of what we’ve worked on in recent years is creating not just a more profitable business but a more stable one. So we really know where revenue is coming from. We always wanted TPM Prime to be a bigger part of our revenue base. We love our advertisers, but fundamentally our readers have a real commitment to our continued existence, whereas our relationships with advertisers are, by definition, purely transitional. That’s the nature of it. You really want a strong foothold of your business to be anchored in people who are really committed to you sticking around. : A huge amount of what we’ve worked on in recent years is creating not just a more profitable business but a more stable one.

There something great and special about any publication that people think is valuable enough that they’re willing to pay for something for it.
Fracking may worsen asthma in children and adults who live near sites where the oil and gas drilling method is used, according to an 8-year study in Pennsylvania.

The study found that asthma treatments were as much as four times more common in patients living closer to areas with more or bigger active wells than those living far away.

Amy Sancetta / ASSOCIATED PRESS

But the study did not establish that fracking directly caused or worsened asthma. There's also no way to tell from the study whether asthma patients exposed to fracking fare worse than those exposed to more traditional gas drilling methods or to other industrial activities.

Fracking refers to hydraulic fracturing, a technique for extracting oil and gas by injecting water, sand and chemicals into wells at high pressure to crack rock. Environmental effects include exhaust, dust and noise from heavy truck traffic transporting water and other materials, and from drilling rigs and compressors. Fracking and improved drilling methods led to a boom in production of oil and gas in several U.S. states, including Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado.

Related: Rising Levels of Gas Found Near Fracking Sites

Sara Rasmussen, the study's lead author and a researcher at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said pollution and stress from the noise caused by fracking might explain the results. But the authors emphasized that the study doesn't prove what caused patients' symptoms.

More than 25 million U.S. adults and children have asthma, a disease that narrows airways in the lungs. Symptoms include wheezing, breathing difficulties and chest tightness, and they can sometimes flare up with exposure to dust, air pollution and stress.

Previous research has found heavy air pollution in areas where oil and gas drilling is booming.

Industry groups responding to the new research said air samplings measured by Pennsylvania authorities near natural gas operations during some of the study years found pollutant levels unlikely to cause health issues. But samplings were limited and didn't reflect potential cumulative effects of emissions from the drilling sites.

The new study was published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The researchers noted that between 2005 and 2012, more than 6,200 fracking wells were drilled in Pennsylvania. They used electronic health records to identify almost 36,000 asthma patients treated during that time in the Geisinger Health System, which covers more than 40 counties in Pennsylvania. Evidence of asthma attacks included new prescriptions for steroid medicines, emergency-room treatment for asthma and asthma hospitalizations.

Related: EPA Says Fracking Has No Widespread Effect on Drinking Water

During the study, there were more than 20,000 new oral steroid prescriptions ordered, almost 5,000 asthma hospitalizations and almost 2,000 ER asthma visits.

Those outcomes were 50 percent to four times more common in asthma patients living closer to areas with more or bigger active wells than among those living far away.

The highest risk for asthma attacks occurred in people living a median of about 12 miles from drilled wells. The lowest risk was for people living a median of about 40 miles away.

Dr. Norman H. Edelman, senior scientific adviser for the American Lung Association, called the study "interesting and provocative." But he said it only shows an association between fracking and asthma, not a "cause and effect," and that more rigorous research is needed.

"Asthma is a huge problem," he said. "Anything we can do to elucidate the causes will be very useful."
Image copyright AFP Image caption AU troops will have a more robust mandate than the 12,000-strong UN force

African leaders have backed plans to deploy regional troops to South Sudan after recent fighting between rival forces left hundreds of people dead.

Soldiers for the African Union (AU) force are to come from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan and Uganda.

A 12,000-strong UN peacekeeping force is already in the country, but the AU force would have a stronger mandate, officials say.

South Sudan's government says it is opposed the deployment of the force.

"We are not ready for a deployment of even a single additional soldier," South Sudan's Information Minister, Michael Makuei Lueth, told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme. "That does not solve the problem."

President Salva Kiir and his rival, Vice-President Riek Machar, announced a ceasefire last week.

Clashes over several days between troops loyal to the two men had threatened a recent peace deal.

"The UN doesn't have the mandate to impose peace," the AFP news agency quoted AU Peace and Security Commissioner Smail Chergui as saying at the AU summit in Rwanda's capital, Kigali.

"They are there where there is peace to keep. African troops are ready to engage in very difficult situations."

He explained that the mission would be similar to the deployment of a 3,000-strong special force that took on the M23 rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2013.

Over the weekend, UN chief Ban Ki-moon expressed his support for the AU deployment.

But Mr Lueth blamed the recent fighting on the peace deal which, he said, was imposed on the country by regional mediators.

"As a sovereign state… this thing cannot be imposed on us without our consent," he said, adding that it would not "serve the interests of the people of South Sudan".

A new challenge for the AU: Analysis by Tomi Oladipo, BBC Monitoring Africa security correspondent

President Kiir will be hoping that the African Union shelves its plan to deploy troops in South Sudan as it did in the case of Burundi. So far the continental body has only sent forces in at the request of the state in need. Theoretically it can intervene against a nation's wishes, which is part of the remit of the new rapid-response African Standby Force.

The AU has a history of talking tough but so far has been unable to rein in problematic African leaders. It is also struggling to fund its operations - so taking on a new intervention force, reliant on external support, will only add to its challenges.

The AU wants to model this new force on the Force Intervention Brigade sent to eastern DR Congo to battle rebel groups. That was a collaboration involving the AU, the UN and the Southern African Development Community. The force defeated the M23 rebels after some 800,000 people had fled their homes during their insurgency.

Mr Kiir's troops make up the majority in and around the capital, Juba. So it would be a huge challenge for the AU force to attempt to call them to order, but it would provide a buffer to the outnumbered troops on Mr Machar's side, whose whereabouts following the recent fighting remains unclear.

Why did the fighting resume?

Image copyright AP Image caption Vice-President Riek Machar, left, and President Salva Kiir have been locked in a power struggle

It seems a disagreement at a checkpoint between rival soldiers led to a shootout on the evening of 7 July in which five soldiers died. This quickly escalated into serious fighting the next day and over the following weekend.

Tensions have been high since April, when Mr Machar returned to Juba under a peace deal following a two-year civil war. He took a 1,300-strong protection force with him and they were supposed to start joint patrols with forces loyal to President Kiir. But a lack of trust between the two sides meant the patrols had not begun.

Will it become a new civil war?

Media caption WATCH: Why is South Sudan on the verge of another civil war?

A ceasefire agreed last week is holding. But the two-year civil war started after clashes between rival soldiers in Juba and degenerated into nationwide conflict in which tens of thousands died.

The war was fought broadly between South Sudan's biggest ethnic groups - the Dinka, led by Mr Kiir, and the Nuer, under Mr Machar.

What is the international community doing?

The international community played a major role in the creation of South Sudan and has tried to exercise some influence since independence in 2011.

The East African regional group, which brokered the peace deal, is behind the plans for a robust regional force to be deployed. Many foreign nationals have been evacuated because of the most recent unrest.

Scores of civilians died Tuesday in airstrikes allegedly carried out by U.S. warplanes on a Syrian village in an area that is the target of a U.S.-backed offensive, according to human rights groups and opposition activists from the area.

The U.S. military said it is investigating claims that American airstrikes were responsible for the deaths of as many as 160 civilians early Tuesday in Tokhar, 10 miles from the northern town of Manbij.

A military statement said investigations are underway into whether the site where the victims died matches any of the locations bombed at the time by American warplanes.

“If the information supporting this allegation is determined to be credible, we will then determine the next appropriate step,” the statement said. The U.S. military takes “all measures during the targeting process to avoid or minimize civilian casualties,” it added.

[U.S.-led air war in Syria has killed hundreds of civilians, study says]





The alleged strikes coincided with intense fighting in the Manbij area as a U.S.-backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters called the Syrian Democratic Forces presses ahead with a seven-week-old offensive to capture Manbij. Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. military announced that the SDF had secured control of the Islamic State headquarters in the town. A separate statement said American warplanes had conducted 18 strikes in the previous 24 hours around Manbij.

Other warplanes involved in the widespread bombing of Syria, including the Russian and Syrian air forces, occasionally stray into areas where the U.S. military is operating.

People from the Manbij area said, however, that U.S.-led coalition warplanes are the only ones that have been bombing in the area since the offensive was launched June 1.

If Tuesday’s reports are confirmed, the tragedy could undermine local support for the U.S.-backed effort to free the strategically important town from militant control, said Jassem al-Sayed, a member of the local council that governed Manbij on behalf of the Syrian opposition before the Islamic State’s takeover in January 2014.

“People are now full of hatred for the SDF. We thought they were coming to finish ISIS, but it seems they are finishing us first,” he said, speaking from the opposition-controlled northern town of Azaz and using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State.

The SDF is overwhelmingly dominated by Kurds, but out of sensitivity to the Arab population of Manbij, the United States has helped enlist local Arab forces in the offensive. Some of them are now questioning whether they want to remain part of the force, Sayed said.

[Video: Obama on airstrikes: We try to avoid civilian casualties]

The Turkey-based Syrian Institute for Justice, which monitors human rights violations in Syria, said it had documented 85 deaths, including entire families who were wiped out, according to Ahmed Mohammed, who works with the group and is from Manbij. He said witnesses told him the warplanes dropped eight to 10 bombs on the village early Tuesday.

“We are documenting with the families of the victims, but secretly, because ISIS will sentence anyone to death who has phone contact with us,” he said.

In a letter Tuesday to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the head of Syria’s opposition negotiating committee to peace talks with the government appealed for an intervention.

Describing “the unprecedented level of civilian killing in the city of Manbij,” Riyad Hijab said that “hundreds of civilians have been killed, mostly children and women. And entire families have been buried under the rubble as a result of the international coalition aircrafts’ bombing of this area.” Hijab said the casualties have been “met with suspicious international silence.”

The Syrian opposition is not allied with the SDF.

Sayed said Tokhar had a prewar population of 3,000, but the figure has been inflated by civilians fleeing the fighting in Manbij. Mohammed added that the strikes destroyed three-quarters of the village and that bodies were still being dug out from the rubble.

A Facebook page operated by activists from Manbij said the toll had reached 160, and it posted grim photographs of mangled bodies covered in dust.

The Islamic State also reported the deaths, claiming in a statement that 160 died.

Zakaria Zakaria in Istanbul and Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report.

A self-driving car by Google is displayed at the Viva Technology event in Paris, France, June 30, 2016.

BERLIN Germany plans new legislation to require manufacturers of cars equipped with an autopilot function to install a black box to help determine responsibility in the event of an accident, transport ministry sources told Reuters on Monday.

The fatal crash of a Tesla Motors Inc Model S car in its Autopilot mode has increased the pressure on industry executives and regulators to ensure that automated driving technology can be deployed safely.

Under the proposal from Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt, drivers will not have to pay attention to traffic or concentrate on steering, but must remain seated at the wheel so they can intervene in the event of an emergency.

Manufacturers will also be required to install a black box that records when the autopilot system was active, when the driver drove and when the system requested that the driver take over, according to the proposals.

The draft is due to be sent to other ministries for approval this summer, a transport ministry spokesman said.

Germany is home to some of the world's largest car companies including Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler and BMW and the government wants the industry to become a global player in the market for self-driving vehicles.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said in April the industry should draw up a wish list for Berlin to help develop self-driving vehicles, ideally with a timetable.

Companies around the globe are working on prototypes for self-driving vehicles, but such cars are not expected to be available for the mass market before 2020.

Turkey has formally charged 99 generals and admirals in connection with the weekend's thwarted coup attempt - just under a third of the country's 356 top military officers.

President Erdogan is meeting with loyal commanders and his cabinet in Ankara.

Authorities have banned all academics from travelling abroad, as the purge of state employees suspected of being connected to the failed coup continues.

More than 50,000 people have been rounded up, sacked or suspended.

So far about 1,577 university deans (faculty heads) have been asked to resign in addition to 21,000 teachers and 15,000 education ministry officials.

They are suspected of having links to the alleged mastermind of the coup, US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen - who denies any involvement.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is chairing an emergency meeting of the National Security Council and is expected to make further announcements later on Wednesday.

As soon as it became clear that the coup had failed, the purges began - first with the security forces, then spreading to Turkey's entire civilian infrastructure.

Human rights group Amnesty International has warned the purges are being extended to censor media outlets and journalists, including those critical of government policy.

"We are witnessing a crackdown of exceptional proportions in Turkey at the moment.

"While it is understandable, and legitimate, that the government wishes to investigate and punish those responsible for this bloody coup attempt, they must abide by the rule of law and respect freedom of expression," Amnesty's Turkey researcher Andrew Gardner said.

Mass ruling party email leak - BBC Monitoring

Image copyright EPA

The WikiLeaks website has been blocked in Turkey after it released thousands of emails purportedly showing exchanges between ruling AKP officials.

The documents - ranging from this month back to 2010 - were obtained a week before the attempted coup and the source has no connection to that event, WikiLeaks says.

Turkish daily Cumhuriyet said that one of the emails contained a letter sent to President Erdogan.

"My family and I suffered in our own country because of your actions. Aren't we as precious as Egyptian Esma?" it says, in a reference to Mr Erdogan's tears on TV after the daughter of a Muslim Brotherhood politician was killed in Egypt.

Other emails contain media reports on Fethullah Gulen and his movement.

Turkey has now extended the clear-out to the education sector in its desire to root out Gulen supporters.

The Higher Education Council has asked university rectors to "urgently examine the situation of all academic and administrative personnel" linked to what it calls the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation (Feto) and report back by 5 August.

It has also told universities that academics who are already abroad on work or study missions should return home "within the shortest possible time".

A government official told the Reuters news agency that the ban on academics travelling abroad was a temporary measure implemented to stop alleged coup plotters in universities from fleeing abroad.

Turkey is pressing the US to extradite Mr Gulen and the issue was raised during a phone call between US President Barack Obama and President Erdogan on Tuesday, the White House said.

Spokesman Josh Earnest said a decision on whether or not to extradite would be made under a treaty between the two countries.

In a separate development Turkey has barred access to the WikiLeaks website soon after it posted about 300,000 emails sent by President Erdogan's AK Party dating from 2000 to early July 2016.

Wikileaks said that although the documents were obtained before the attempted coup, the date of their publication was brought forward "in response to the government's post-coup purges".

The source of the emails was not linked to the coup plotters or to a rival political party or country, WikiLeaks said.

Turkey's military also announced on Wednesday that it had resumed cross-border strikes against Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq, killing about 20 alleged militants. They were the first since the attempted coup.

F-16 jets were reported to have targeted positions of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Iraq's Hakurk region, Anadolu Agency reported.

The Turkish military has regularly targeted suspected PKK bases in Iraq since last year.

For the past week or so, many Microsoft watchers have been speculating on which of the latest Windows 10 Anniversary Update test builds might be "the one."

Microsoft execs don't want us to use RTM (release to manufacturing) or even RTW (release to Web) any more, now that Windows 10 is a continually updated "service," but most of us still are using the RTM convention to refer to the build that ultimately will go to "normals" who aren't in the Windows Insider program.

Quite a few folks are speculating that today's Windows 10 Anniversary Update test build for PCs and Mobile -- No. 14393 -- could well be the RTM release.

Microsoft officials are not going to be calling any of these test builds "RTM." Nor are they likely to let anyone know which of these near-final test builds are "soup." In the case of the November update of Windows 10 (Threshold 2), Microsoft released the RTM build on November 5. That release, the first "major update" to Windows 10, was generally available on November 12.

My sources have said Microsoft's internal goal is to sign off on an Insider preview test build by July 20, this Wednesday, in order to have the second major update to Windows 10 -- a ka the Anniversary Update -- ready to be generally available on August 2 on PCs, tablets, phones, and other devices, as is the plan.

The 14393 preview build includes no new features, but a few remaining fixes for both phones and PCs. In the notes about the new build, Windows Insider chief Dona Sarkar notes that those having issues with their cameras on Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book when running the latest Insider builds should see a driver update to fix this soon via Windows Update.

Embed Hillary Clinton: 'We White Americans...Need to Recognize Our Privilege' 1:43 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

CINCINNATI — Hillary Clinton on Monday called for "all good people" to speak out "loudly and clearly" against violence after the killings of police officers in Baton Rouge.

"This madness has to stop," Clinton said at the annual NAACP conference. "We have difficult, painful, essential work ahead of us to repair the bonds between our police and our communities and between and among each other."

Responding to tragedy in speeches like this has become commonplace for Clinton in recent weeks. She gave similar remarks after five police officers were killed in Dallas earlier this month. Hours before that shooting happened, she was set to give a speech about the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, both black men fatally shot by police this month.

"All of this tells us very powerfully that we have to change. Many police officers across the country agree with that. But it can only happen if we build trust and accountability and let's admit it--that gets harder every time someone else is killed," she said.

"Now is the time for all good people who agree that the senseless killings must end to stand up and speak out loudly and clearly."

Clinton also used her speech to knock her general election opponent, Donald Trump, who declined an invitation to speak at the same conference. Clinton slammed what she called divisive rhetoric and said the country needs a president "who can help pull us together, not split us apart."

The speech kicked off a series of counter-programming events to the Republican National Convention. Clinton will be speaking at five events total during the first two days of the RNC.

"We all know about that other convention happening up in Cleveland today. Now, my opponent in this race may have a different view, but there's nowhere I'd rather be than right here with all of you," she said.

To close, an emotional Clinton quoted the Facebook post of one of the officers killed Sunday in Baton Rouge. "He wrote so honestly and powerfully about the struggle of being black and wearing blue in today's America," Clinton said. "That, my friends, is the strength of America. Men like Montrell Jackson."
As a chorus of prominent Fox News women have gone public defending Roger Ailes against the wave of sexual-harassment allegations sparked by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s lawsuit, the network’s biggest star, Megyn Kelly, has been conspicuously silent. Kelly’s refusal to join in Ailes’s orchestrated defense has led to speculation about why.

Now we have the answer. According to two sources briefed on parent company 21st Century Fox’s outside probe of the Fox News executive, led by New York–based law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. Kelly, according to the sources, has described her harassment by Ailes in detail.

Kelly’s comments to investigators might explain why the Murdochs are moving so quickly to oust Ailes. As New York reported yesterday, Rupert and sons James and Lachlan, the three top executives at 21st Century Fox, have, according to multiple sources, decided that Ailes needs to be removed. Kelly, who has become something of a feminist icon thanks to her tangles with GOP nominee Donald Trump, is seen by many inside Fox as the future of the network. She’s currently in contract negotiations, and given that Bill O’Reilly has said he’s considering retirement, Fox can’t afford to lose her.

According to two sources, Monday afternoon lawyers for 21st Century Fox gave Ailes a deadline of August 1 to resign or face being fired for cause. Ailes’s legal team — which now includes Susan Estrich, former campaign manager for Michael Dukakis — has yet to respond to the offer. Ailes has also received advice on strategy from Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani, sources say.

Ailes’s strategy so far has included attacking Kelly in the press. According to sources, Ailes spokesperson Irena Briganti has been criticizing Kelly to reporters, saying she is selfish to not stand up for the man who gave her career opportunities. Roughly a dozen Fox women have praised Ailes since Carlson filed her suit. According to a Fox source, the pro-Ailes campaign has been led by Fox anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle, who has filled in hosting Carlson's former 2 p.m. time slot.

Briganti did not respond to a request for comment.

Back in the mid-2000s, when Ailes allegedly harassed her, Kelly, a former corporate attorney, was a legal correspondent in Fox’s Washington bureau. Soon she was appearing regularly on Bill O’Reilly’s show and hosting her own legal segments. In 2010, Ailes gave her a two-hour daytime show, and in 2013, he moved her into prime time to replace Sean Hannity at 9 p.m.

Kelly’s agent Matthew DelPiano at CAA did not respond to requests for comment. 21st Century Fox did not comment.

Meanwhile, the Paul, Weiss lawyers are attempting to interview former Fox employees who have stories of harassment but haven’t spoken because they signed settlements with Ailes’s Fox attorney, Dianne Brandi. 21st Century Fox is now waiving the NDAs to allow women to speak.

Her silence about Roger Ailes is barbecuing his raw hamburger meat.

Despite a parade of Fox News Channel hosts who continue to fall over themselves to defend their chief against allegations of sexual harrassment, star anchor Megyn Kelly is conspicuously mum.

Fox News CEO Ailes and “Fox & Friends” co-host Steve Doocy became the subjects of an internal Fox investigation after formerly high-profile anchor Gretchen Carlson slapped the executive with a lawsuit alleging that she was booted from the network after she refused Ailes’ sexual advances.

While on-air talent like Greta Van Sustern and Jeanine Pirro have vocally supported Ailes, a slew of other women have come forward to relate their own allegations of sexual harassment against him. Their claims go back decades, with one describing his private parts as resembling raw, ground beef.

Trump defends FNC boss Ailes from sexual harassment allegations

Since Kelly is not talking about the allegations - at least not yet - there’s no way to know exactly why she’s staying quiet, but here are some ideas:

Feminist icon?

Following her ugly dust-up with Donald Trump last year (which, it’s worth noting, contributed heavily to her rising stardom), Kelly has embarked on what seems to be a quest to become a feminist icon.

In June she appeared in a promotional video with celebrities like Lena Dunham, Kerry Washington for Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg’s “Lean in Together” campaign, encouraging women to support other women in the workplace.

Maintaining her personal brand may have a lot to do with her silence. As a Fox News insider told The Daily Beast’s Lloyd Grove: “My impression is she doesn’t want to be on the opposite side of a woman, period. She really believes that she’s plowing new ground for girls and women. It’s ‘I am cable-show host, hear me roar.’”

Ailes didn’t protect her from O’Reilly?

While Ailes has groomed her for years to be star — and defended her repeatedly against Trump’s vicious, sexist attacks last year — Kelly may still be miffed about how Ailes’ didn’t curb others at Fox, especially Bill O’Reilly.

Her hands-on boss famously keeps everyone at Fox on a tight leash, although O’Reilly has always managed to march to his own drum.

After Trump bashed Kelly during a Jan. 27 “O’Reilly Factor” interview — just minutes before the opening moments of her own show — she later called the interview “a dark moment” and said if the roles had been reversed, she would’ve stuck up for O’Reilly.

Keeping quiet and classy worked before

Some at Fox News are said to be stewing over her silence, this above the fray approach worked for Kelly when she found herself at the center of the Trump story.

Kelly is in talks for a new contract

She’s negotiating a new deal with Fox and talking to other networks about a potential new job. so anything she says, or doesn’t say, can have an impact on her career and her reportedly $15 million salary.

Either way, for a TV host famed for being outspoken the fact that she hasn’t said a word speaks volumes.
The most important prototype of Motorola’s new Moto Z smartphone wasn’t a phone at all. It was just a wafer-thin slab of machined purple-pink aluminum. Codename: Ice. As Paul Fordham snatches Ice off his desk and holds it up in front of his face, he squints at it, like he still can’t believe they made something this thin. Fordham, Motorola’s lead mechanical architect and one of the four original engineers working on Motorola’s modular phone program, built Ice to show the rest of the company how truly cool this thing was going to be. He holds a battery case to the back of the “phone” and it jumps into place with a satisfying magnetic click.

The Z team always demo’d the Ice prototype the same way. They’d go into a meeting and put the device on the table. Oh, cool, everyone would say, that’s a nice-looking phone. Then Fordham or whoever else would pick up the phone and peel it in half. “We’d separate it like this,” Fordham says, now popping the two pieces apart with a magician’s flourish at his desk in Motorola’s Chicago offices. He’d then hand someone the front part, that slab of aluminum half as thick as an iPhone, and tell them the part they were holding was to be a fully functioning smartphone. “Their mouths would drop.” Then he’d tell them about all the other things Motorola was planning to build for the back of the phone, too.

The case for modular smartphones like the Moto Z comes down to this: Our phones are the most personal, most important devices in our lives. So we, the users, should decide how our our phones look, how they work, and what they can do. Just like we have the app store, we should have an add-on store. We should be able to snap something—a camera, a projector, a speaker, a temperature sensor, a point-of-sale system—onto the back of our smartphone and change the very nature of the device. Then, a few minutes later, we should be able to snap on something else.

Motorola is not the only company interested in the idea. LG has already launched a (quasi-) modular phone, as have upstarts like Fairphone and Puzzlephone. Even Google is working on a modular smartphone, coming out … eventually. Meanwhile, Motorola itself has been bought and sold, moved offices, and changed leadership. But its plan was always the same: Motorola intends to build a device that’s an excellent smartphone first and a thousand other things after that. And now, after all the planning and prototyping and corporate upheaval, the Moto Z is finally about to go on sale.

Lego My Smartphone

Iqbal Arshad doesn’t actually like modular phones. This sounds odd coming from Motorola’s SVP of engineering and global product development, the man more responsible for this modular phone than any other single person. But Arshad, a quiet man with slick hair and a black dress shirt tucked into his black slacks, volunteers the opinion early into our conversation.

When he says he doesn’t like modular phones, what Arshad really means is he doesn’t like the kind of modular phones that make every part interchangeable, so that you select the processor and the screen and the memory and the battery and whoops you forgot storage and now your phone doesn’t work. “It’s much easier to understand the idea of bolting on accessories,” says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, “to optimize your phone for a specific use case than it is to understand swapping out the innards.” People don’t want to think about their processors and screens, they just want them to be good. They’d rather think about all the cool other stuff they can do.

What Arshad loves about the Moto Z is that it doesn’t involve the trade-offs phones have always required. Previously, if Arshad and his team made a thinner phone, battery life would get worse. They could use a lower-power processor, which would mitigate the battery problem, but then people’s phones would be slow and outdated really quickly. So Motorola would make three versions of every phone, or kill a beloved feature like a hardware keyboard because it wasn’t so mainstream anymore. Then they had an idea: What if, instead of making these trade-offs in a conference room, they let people make these trade-offs for themselves? How would that even work?

The very first prototype of how that would even work was a Droid Razr Maxx with a motherboard attached to its back like an exoskeleton. Arshad still has it, and holds it delicately, pointing out the many different ports and plugs. “This has about 52 different interfaces,” he says, everything a Motorola engineer would be able to access: the camera, the display, the fingerprint sensor, all the wireless minutiae, everything. “And we said, OK, what if this was available to all of the app ecosystem?” What if Spotify could also build your phone’s speaker? What if Snapchat could build a camera? What if Pokémon Go could add a real AR rig to the back of every smartphone? This became the driving idea behind the Moto Z: Don’t make people build their own smartphone; let people build whatever they want on top of their smartphone.

Motorola needed a phone design suitable for these add-ons, which the team quickly began to call “mods.” It also needed a big ecosystem of mods, or it would just be selling a really thin phone with a weird connector sticking out. That wouldn’t work. So Motorola started to build a few mods in-house, like a projector, just to show off what was possible. It also reached out to long-standing partners like JBL, which built a speaker mod called Soundboost, and Incipio, which created a battery mod. Now it’s talking to dozens of other partners and working on ways to get everyone else building mods, too.

11

To that end, Motorola is also launching a module development kit to simplify the mod-making process. “We tried to eliminate all the barriers for someone creating hardware,” says Jarrett Simerson, a senior director of engineering, as he stands in one of Motorola’s many labs. He shows me the reference designs Motorola created, which contain the connector and housing you’d need for a mod—all developers have to do is drop a motherboard into the slot. Developers have access to a reference for a sensor-driven mod, like for temperature or moisture; one for adding a second screen to the back of the Moto Z; another for adding an extra battery.

The key difference between a mod and an accessory is that your phone treats a mod as if it were part of the phone itself. That means JBL can access uncompressed audio from the Moto Z and that Incipio’s case conspires with the built-in battery to power and charge as efficiently as possible. You don’t have to reboot your phone or wade into Bluetooth settings. There’s nothing to enable or turn on. Your new speaker is the phone’s new speaker.

The first mods on the Z are all meant to fix the things that obviously suck about a smartphone: the battery life, the audio. Someone (Motorola won’t say who, but it’s almost certainly Hasselblad) is working on a camera mod, coming soon. At one point Motorola even built a sandwich mod. “So you could have a bunch of mods together,” says Fordham. Motorola didn’t end up making it, but someone will. Hopefully.

Arshad imagines life-proofing mods, point-of-sale mods that could replace those horrible tricorders the UPS guy uses, VR capture mods, insulin-monitoring mods. Even a projector mod could be used for a thousand things. “You can stick this next to your bed,” Arshad says, “and it’s pointing up on the ceiling. You can wake up in the morning and say Hey, what’s my schedule like?” Google Now could project the answer up over your face instead of just reading it aloud. And it’s really not that far from there to Leia-style holograms. Arshad just laughs when I point this out. I’m not the first person to do so.

Thinnovation

To carry all these snap-on tools, the Z had to be as thin and light as possible. Period. “If anyone even mentioned going over 3.99” millimeters, Fordham says, “they’re out of the room.” Motorola wanted to make a phone so thin and light that it felt normal-sized with a mod attached. But it also wanted it to be a best-in-the-world kind of smartphone.

So here’s what Arshad’s team did: They developed a new type of connector that makes the dozens of interfaces available over two rows of eight pins. They moved the phone’s antenna to the outside of the chassis, where it wouldn’t be covered by the mods. They figured out a liquid-cooling system for their tiny new motherboard, which they had to redesign with a new emissions shield to keep the whole thing from getting too hot. They made a new kind of steel alloy, so this super-thin phone wouldn’t bend like Gumby. They learned everything they could about magnets, to make the mods stick on without any ugly extruding clips.

OK, so there were actually a few trade-offs along the way. The phone is now a whopping 5.2 millimeters thick (the Moto Z Force, which also has a shatterproof display, is a more average 7 millimeters), with a big round camera hump on its back. Luckily, the hump is a good alignment point for mods, which all have a circle cut-out that goes around the lens. The end result is still an extremely striking Android smartphone.

But the Moto Z is really just a base station, a mannequin onto which you drape the clothes you pick. That’s good for users, and it’s good for developers too, who don’t have to convince Samsung or Apple (or Motorola) to put their tech into an upcoming phone. They can just make a mod and sell it to anyone who’s interested—easy enough now that smartphone components are cheap, sophisticated, and ubiquitous. “It’s as though someone dumped a shipping container worth of Lego on the floor,” venture capitalist Benedict Evans wrote in 2015. Motorola’s goal is to be the hub of an ecosystem of mod-builders, clicking components together so you can click them onto your phone.

Everything depends on Motorola becoming that hub. The company is great at cell phone innovation—it invented the damn thing and then made the StarTac and the Razr and the first Droid. But the company is not so great at actually making money. Meanwhile, Google’s Project Ara, which has done more than any other project to get people interested in modular phones, isn’t close to releasing a real product. The modular phones that do exist are either small stakes, like the Fairphone and Puzzlephone, or flops like the LG G5. “I suspect we’ll see more experimentation with this stuff over the next year or two,” Jackdaw’s Dawson says, “but I wouldn’t be surprised if both Motorola and LG eventually backed away from this approach.” He cautions that without a standard for mods that’s widely adopted, Samsung is really “the only Android vendor big enough to be able to create an ecosystem of its own around its phone hardware.”

It’s also not a good sign that Google sold Motorola for about 80 bucks and a pack of smokes, or that current owner Lenovo is reportedly thinking about killing the Motorola brand altogether. The Moto Z and Moto Mods might turn out to be the last gasp for a flailing brand.

But I hope not. At the very least, I hope the rest of the smartphone industry keeps trying to make modular phones happen, no matter what becomes of the Moto Z. Today we can transform our smartphone into a thousand different things—a taxi hailer, a video recorder, a Pokémon catcher—just by rearranging its pixels. Imagine the thousand different things we could do if we could rearrange the smartphone itself.
The UK will take in more refugee children from Syria and other conflict zones, the Home Office has announced, but the Government will not act on calls to resettle 3,000 children living unaccompanied in Europe.

In an apparent compromise, Britain will work with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) to bring unaccompanied refugee children to the UK from Syria and other war-torn regions.

Officials said the exact numbers of refugee children to be resettled in the UK would be assessed by UNHCR experts working in Syria and elsewhere, but confirmed that new arrivals would be additional to the 20,000 Syrian refugees the Government has pledged to take in by 2020.

Ministers had said this week that they were “considering” calls to take in some of the thousands of unaccompanied refugee children currently in Europe, who charities say are especially vulnerable to exploitation and traffickers.

However, the new pledge appears to extinguish any prospect of the UK taking in refugees from Europe. Instead, a new £10 million fund will be established to support migrant and refugee children in Europe.

Immigration minister James Brokenshire said the “vast majority” of refugees were “better served staying in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members”.

“So we have asked the UNHCR to identify the exceptional cases where a child’s best interests are served by resettlement to the UK and help us to bring them here,” he said.
A government lawyer has told the High Court in London that Britain will not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty this year.

Lawyer Jason Coppel QC referred to statements made by Prime Minister Theresa May who has said the legislation should not be triggered this year.

However, he indicated that the Government's current position could change.

It follows Prime Minister Theresa May's announcement last week that Britain will not start the process of leaving the European Union until Scotland’s position in negotiations is clear.

Ms May said after a meeting with Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon she would not formally start the process of leaving the bloc until there was a coherent “UK approach” to negotiations.

“Scotland’s very important to me. When I stood on the steps of Downing Street on Wednesday I made clear that I believe in the United Kingdom,” Ms May said.

Ros Kellaway, head of Eversheds' EU Competition and Regulatory Group, said in a statement: "Although the situation is clearly fluid, this formal indication that the government is in no great rush to invoke Article 50 is welcome news for businesses.

"As things stand, we still don't have clarity on what Britain can expect from the terms of engagement with the EU once negotiations have begun, let alone what the wider parameters are.

"Businesses could be forgiven for being fearful of protracted Article 50 negotiations, but the reality is, a longer wait to get things right will be very much in their best interests, especially so given the staggeringly complex and multi-faceted nature of Brexit."

A government must trigger the article by officially notifying the EU of its intention to leave. Then there is a two-year period in which the terms of the leaver’s exit are negotiated.

During this time Britain would no longer be able to take part in any EU decision-making, and any exit agreements must be approved by all 27 remaining EU nations and the European Parliament. Then after Britain’s formal exit, fresh negotiations can begin on any new trade deals.
Severe storms that swept across the Northeast on Monday left one woman dead and knocked out power for tens of thousands.

The storms moved violently through Pennsylvania and all the way up to Northern New England, leaving at least 100,000 without power across 13 states at the height of the storm. And on Tuesday, more than 12,000 customers remained without power, according to utility companies.

The outages were due largely to heavy rains, large hail and severe winds. A tornado was reported in Woodland, Maine, according to the National Weather Service.

While tornado warnings in Maine and New Hampshire are rare, according to Weather.com meteorologist Brian Donegan, tornado warnings were issued in both states on Monday. And large hail was reported in many parts of New England, according to the NWS.

More than 300 flights into and out of New Jersey's Newark Airport, New York's LaGuardia Airport, and Boston's Logan Airport were canceled Monday, according to FlightAware.com.

The summer storms resulted in at least one death when a wire came down on a woman's car in Fanwood, New Jersey, according to NBC New York. The 26-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was electrocuted when she tried to get out of the car.

The storms had moved out by Tuesday, but the mid-section of the country would be dealing with another danger — scorching heat, according to the NWS.

Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani ignited the crowd at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on Monday, painting a picture of Donald Trump as someone who can do for America what he claimed he once did for the Big Apple — “make [it] one again.”

“It is time to make America safe again,” he began, repeating the evening’s theme. Trump will do, apparently, by calling Islamic extremists what they are — “Islamic extremist terrorists,” or “Islamic terrorist extremists,” or “extremist terrorist Islamists.”

Despite the variability with which he phrased these three words, Giuliani insisted that “failing to identify them properly maligns decent Muslims around the world. It also sets up a fear of being politically incorrect that can have serious consequences. And it has — we must not be afraid to define our enemies. This is why our enemies see us as weak and vulnerable.”
Joseph Kahn, who directed Taylor Swift in videos for “Bad Blood,” “Blank Space,” and “Wildest Dreams,” has come to the singer’s defense against Kanye West and Kim Kardashian by invoking the death of Nicole Brown Simpson.

In a series of tweets posted Monday, Kahn slammed the Kardashian family, writing it wasn’t “the first time the Kardashians supported the murder of an innocent blonde woman.” Robert Kardashian, father to Kim Kardashian, was a member of O.J. Simpson’s defense team after the former football star was accused of killing Nicole Brown Simpson.

After he was criticized for the comparison, Kahn later added, “How dare you bring up a murder of a woman with the Kardashians – when no one knew what a Kardashian was until they supported the murderer!” In a subsequent tweet, he also mocked Kim Kardashian’s sex tape, which was leaked online in 2007. “People always ask me how to be famous. My answer is simple. Have your dad defend murder of a woman. Release sex tape. That’s it. Good luck.”

Kahn’s comments came after Kim Kardashian released a video to Snapchat showing Swift and West had spoken about the rapper’s song “Famous,” and it’s controversial lyric, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.” Swift long denied any conversations took place, and slammed the song after its release. In the video, however, West is heard telling Swift about the first part of the lyric, though he left out its “I made that bitch famous” conclusion.

Swift focused on that omission in her statement on the matter, writing, “Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song?’ It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world.”

Kahn previously defended Swift after she was accused of depicting colonialism in her video for “Wildest Dreams,” which Kahn directed. “There is no political agenda in the video. Our only goal was to tell a tragic love story in classic Hollywood iconography,” Kahn wrote of the video, which was filmed Botswana and South Africa, and stars Swift and Scott Eastwood as actors making a romantic movie. “Furthermore, this video has been singled out, yet there have been many music videos depicting Africa. These videos have traditionally not been lessons in African history. Let’s not forget, Taylor has chosen to donate all of her proceeds from this video to the African Parks Foundation to preserve the endangered animals of the continent and support the economies of local African people.”

For those looking to binge on every piece of news and information coming out of the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, rest assured: The impending political apocalypse will be streamed live across the web.

While broadcast networks plan to air important speeches and snippets of important moments during prime-time hours on TV, a whole host of social platforms and publishers plan to bring gavel-to-gavel coverage of both conventions over the next two weeks. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Twitch will air speeches from each convention in full as they happen. Facebook is also building a studio space at each convention where dozens of publishers can broadcast live.

News outlets, too, are dedicating resources to cover the conventions using live video with a focus on providing context beyond what viewers might see on the stage. Here’s a guide to what many of them will be up to:

Advertisement

ABC News

On ABC News’ website and mobile and TV apps, viewers will have the chance to pick from as many as eight simultaneous live streams of video from the conventions. These streams will feature everything from speeches on the stage — including multiple angles of said speeches — to analysis of the latest news and interviews with politicians, delegates, attendees and protesters both inside and outside of the conventions. In a partnership with Facebook, ABC News will also broadcast these feeds across different pages on Facebook, including ABC News and ABC News Politics.

ABC News reporters have also been equipped with a mobile app called LiveU, which will allow them to broadcast live whenever an interesting opportunity presents itself.

“People don’t want to be just shown one thing,” said Dan Silver, executive producer of ABC News Digital. “They want to be provided context, want options and want to be educated.”

CBSN

CBSN, CBS News’ ad-supported video streaming network, is sending nearly 45 staffers to the RNC and 35 to the DNC as part of the larger CBS News contingent. In addition to CBSN’s site and apps, the network’s coverage will also be streamed in full on Twitter via a partnership between the two companies. The video feed will be paired with a curated selection of tweets from viewers and convention attendees.

“Twitter’s move into live streaming is a great place for experimenting,” said Christy Tanner, svp and gm of CBS News Digital. “It’s a new way of delivering news and provides us with opportunities to engage users.”

In terms of content, CBSN will also look to pull double-duty by airing speeches onstage as well as covering everything that’s happening in and around the convention. With the Twitter integration, the outlet will incorporate questions asked by Twitter users when such opportunities present themselves.

“So much of this election has gone in a way that the established experts haven’t anticipated,” said Nancy Lane, senior executive producer for CBS News Digital. “We want to make sure those people have a voice and feel heard.”

CNN

On TV, CNN will unsurprisingly have ample live coverage of both conventions. Online, Facebook Live is a “big part of” how CNN plans to reach viewers who aren’t watching the televised speeches, said Samantha Barry, head of social media for CNN.

CNN plans to go live on Facebook at least once or twice during lunchtime every day of both conventions. The focus will be on bringing in different correspondents, reporters and special guests for deeper analysis about what’s going on. For instance, yesterday’s lunch-hour live stream featured CNN political director David Chalian and national political reporter M.J. Lee answering viewers’ questions ahead of the madness.

Overall, CNN aims to go live on Facebook numerous times a day across the CNN, CNN Politics and CNN International Facebook pages. (For instance, live streams on CNN International will feature Christiane Amanpour analyzing news from an international perspective.)

We have a bird’s-eye view of the #GOPConvention‘s first day. Watch live on Facebook: https://t.co/IHby73poaf pic.twitter.com/OuloB31vau — CNN (@CNN) July 18, 2016

While CNN doesn’t have a dedicated Facebook Live team for its convention plans, dozens of people — ranging from on-air talent to news reporters — will have a hand in producing the content, said Barry.

“We can’t deny that people are consuming content on Facebook Live. We want to be the trusted source for news and info on that platform,” she said.

The Huffington Post

The Huffington Post does not any plans to air what’s happening on the stage at the RNC and DNC — it wants to cover everything else. Of the 50 people The Huffington Post has covering the conventions, five are dedicated solely to producing Facebook live videos. Of that group, two staffers — a producer and a shooter — will be focused on covering what’s happening on the ground as it happens. The remaining three, which includes an on-air host, will be doing planned live videos that focus on different issues related to the convention and the host cities.

The Huffington Post will also use Facebook’s live video lounge, producing an “after-show” each night of the RNC and DNC. Overall, expect The Huffington Post to go live between two and four times a day.

“The whole advantage of our [live formats] is that it allows viewers to interact and ask questions and offer suggestions,” said Patrick McMenamin, supervising producer of HuffPost Video. “The idea is to bring our audience to Cleveland and more directly experience the chaos.”

Univision

The Hispanic broadcaster has 12 people from its digital team to the RNC and expects to do the same with the DNC next week. Within that group, it has directed two people to focus on social content, which includes Facebook live videos. These two staffers will work with two colleagues based in Univision’s Miami headquarters to create as many as five daily live videos covering issues important to Hispanic voters.

Of course, these staffers are behind the tablet. Like other news outlets, Univision will also bring in reporters and on-air talent like Jorge Ramos to host some of the live content.

“The brand is what it is because of people like Jorge Ramos,” said Carlos Chirinos, senior political editor for Univision. “We can take advantage of the fact that they’re trusted by their audience, who will follow and pay attention to what they have to say.”
Milo Yiannopoulos, the tech editor at conservative news site Breitbart and a pretty notorious internet troll, has been suspended from Twitter for the final time. He’s now banned for good for repeatedly abusing other users, the company confirmed Tuesday.

Yiannopoulos crossed the line Monday when he went after actress Leslie Jones on the microblogging site. Jones was harassed and taunted by users, many of them sending her racist images and slurs. She ultimately signed off “with tears and a very sad heart” after publicly pleading with Twitter to intervene.

Yiannopoulos, who had 338,000 followers and a Twitter bio that called him “The most fabulous supervillain on the internet,” was one of the main instigators. He tweeted that Jones was “barely literate” and also referred to her as a man.

The permanent ban means that Twitter will essentially keep Yiannopoulos off its network in any way possible, including finding and suspended any new accounts he creates. It’s the same punishment Twitter has handed down to other repeat trolls, like rapper Azealia Banks and Gotnews founder Chuck Johnson.

Here’s a lengthy statement a Twitter spokesperson shared with Recode. It doesn’t address Yiannopoulos specifically, but says the company is exploring changes to its “hateful conduct policy”:

People should be able to express diverse opinions and beliefs on Twitter. But no one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. Over the past 48 hours in particular, we’ve seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts, ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of Tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension. We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter. We agree. We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it's happening and prevent repeat offenders. We have been in the process of reviewing our hateful conduct policy to prohibit additional types of abusive behavior and allow more types of reporting, with the goal of reducing the burden on the person being targeted. We’ll provide more details on those changes in the coming weeks.

We’ve reached out to Yiannopoulos and will update if we hear back.

Getting Yiannopoulos off Twitter is a step in the right direction. But the issue, of course, is that Twitter is full of people like him, most of whom are much less known or completely anonymous.

What happened to Jones is not an isolated incident. It’s getting attention because Jones is famous — Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey even reached out to her directly last night in an apparent effort to help — but abuse is clearly still a problem on Twitter and the company has been struggling for years to fix it. Having these scenarios play out anywhere on Twitter, especially in the public eye, is not good business.

So, yes, banning Yiannopoulos is a small victory. But it came at a terrible price.
Is Your Sales Process Broken?

Let's be honest. Sales in a typical organization (most organizations in fact), is seriously broken. But rather than focusing on the obvious dysfunction, management is busy with incremental improvement initiatives:

Sales training Sales force automation (technology of various types) Bolt-on lead-generation activities (outsourced telemarketing, for example) New commission structures and incentives

Trouble is, none of these activities actually address the root cause of the dysfunction.

Sure, they may offer a temporary lift but things always go back to the way they were.
To the outsider at least, the immediate problem with the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)—a perennial vortex of instability, massive human rights violations and wars both petty and large—is that it defies comprehension. The armed militia factions, opportunistic and often wholly predatory, are many. There are at least 10 such groups in the eastern part of the country alone, which for several years now has been the epicenter of the bloodshed and chaos.

The recent approval by the UN Security Council of two extraordinary measures to deal with the situation in that country—the use of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide reconnaissance of militia activity, and the deployment of an intervention brigade to take offensive measures against the militia groups—is being hailed by most observers as a potential turning point in the country’s recent unhappy history. Though the UN has been careful to present the measures as purely temporary and confined to the DRC, they do indeed constitute a turning point in UN peace missions. Their success—if they do succeed—will undoubtedly lead to their being hailed as “best practice,” and radically change the hopeless trajectory of the Congo.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has welcomed the measures as a “comprehensive approach aimed at addressing the root causes of instability in the eastern DRC and the Great Lakes region.” But optimism has necessarily to be tempered, analysts believe.

The 24 February 2013 “Framework for Peace, Security and Cooperation for the DRC and the Region,” which provides the basis for the intervention brigade, does indeed offer a comprehensive approach to the problem. The framework, which the African Union assisted to put together, was signed in Ethiopia by leaders from the DRC, Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, in the presence of Mr. Ban, who acted as one of the guarantors. The framework speaks of the suffering in the country engendered by “recurring cycles of conflict and persistent violence by armed groups, both Congolese and foreign.”

The current path, the framework says, is untenable. It sets out an agenda for the consolidation of state authority and the prevention of outside support to armed groups. It also contains a pledge by the DRC to respect “the legitimate concerns and interests” of neighbouring countries, an implicit reference to Rwanda’s long-held security concerns about the operation of anti-government Hutu militants based in eastern Congo.

Mr. Ban raised the issue of the intervention brigade in the Security Council shortly after his return from Ethiopia last March. He told Security Council members that the envisaged brigade would operate under the command of the UN mission in the DRC, MONUSCO, and would cost $140 million (in addition to the $1.4 billion it costs MONUSCO to maintain 19,815 troops annually). On 27 December, Mr. Ban also wrote to the Security Council requesting approval for the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, by MONUSCO for “advanced information collation, analysis and dissemination to enhance situational awareness and to permit timely decision-making.”

Last January, the Security Council approved the request to use UAVs in the Congo “without prejudice to the ongoing consideration by relevant United Nations bodies of legal, financial and technical implications of the use of unmanned aerial systems.”

The trigger for these measures was the brutal occupation of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province in eastern DRC, by the M23 in November of last year. The event was a serious setback to both the Congolese and the UN.

Two days after the fall of Goma, the government suspended its commander of ground forces, Gen. Gabriel Amisi Kumba, who had been accused several times of atrocities by human rights groups—in addition to being accused by the UN Panel of Experts a few months before of selling weapons and ammunitions to illegal armed groups.

The occupation of Goma underlined two perennial problems: the weakness of the DRC to exist as a nation and the readiness of armed rebel groups to exploit this weakness.

The intervention brigade was approved by UN resolution 2098 of 18 March, which states that the intervention brigade will be a rapid reaction force that will conduct “targeted offensive operations” against rebel groups in the country.

The brigade, consisting of 3,069 troops, is led by a Tanzanian general, and is organised into three infantry battalions, one artillery unit, one Special Forces unit and a reconnaissance company. Crack troops from Tanzania, South Africa and Malawi have already been contributed to it, and its mission is to “prevent the expansion of all armed groups, neutralize these groups, and disarm them.”

The UN appears determined to emphasize the “exceptional basis” for approving the intervention brigade, averring in the resolution that it is not creating “a precedent or any prejudice to the agreed principles of peacekeeping.” The resolution also calls for a “clear exit strategy” for the brigade.

As if on cue, a day after the resolution was adopted, M23’s founder, Gen. Bosco Ntaganda, surrendered in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, and was handed over to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The M23 had suffered a violent split at the end of February, leading to serious fighting between the main faction, led by Sultani Makenga, and a smaller faction led by Ntaganda. The M23 had announced a unilateral ceasefire on 7 January, but few took this seriously given the group’s opportunistic character and its lack of a unified front.

Will the drones and the intervention brigade change the chaotic, bloodstained trajectory of the Congo? Its forces, from countries with uneven capacities, will have to choose their targets very carefully to be effective, some observers advise. But a potential target—M23—has already asserted itself.

In April, the M23 wrote an open letter describing Tanzania’s decision to participate in the intervention brigade as a “dangerous adventure.” The letter, signed by Bertrand Bisimwa, the political leader of M23, called on Tanzania to pull out of the brigade. Bisimwa wrote a similar letter to South Africa, which is contributing over 1,000 well-equipped troops to the intervention brigade. Both South Africa and Tanzania dismissed the threats. Tanzanian foreign minister Bernard Membe told his country’s parliament, in response to M23, that “we are not going to Congo as lords of war, we are going there as advocates of peace to help our neighbours.”

The M23 is said to have about 2,000 armed fighters, but its real strength in the past came from the support it allegedly got from Rwanda, a charge Rwanda has strongly denied. Rwanda is a signatory to the framework signed in February; on signing it, Rwandan President Paul Kagame noted that “nothing would be of greater benefit to Rwanda than real progress toward regional peace and stability.” Rwanda is also currently an elected member of the Security Council, and it played an important role in the Council’s adoption of Resolution 2098.

Analysts believe M23 could find itself isolated; without serious internal support in the Congo, and harassed as it already is by other Congolese militia groups like Raia Mutomboki, it could be defeated by the intervention brigade and the Congolese forces.

The mission is not an easy one, however. As Helmoed Romer Heitman, a South African military analyst, told Reuters, “It’s a complex mission. From a tactical point of view this is a logistical nightmare because you don’t know who’s who in the zoo from one day to the next.”

Mr. Heitman was referring to the proliferation of competing militia factions in eastern Congo. Taking count of the array of militia groups is a favourite parlour game among diplomats and foreign journalists in Kinshasa. Among the most notorious, you will hear, are the Raia Mutomboki or Angry Citizens Alliance, a multiethnic coalition that appears to control a huge chunk of territory, and to sordid effect (the UN recently accused it of massacring at least 243 women and children in North Kivu); the Nyatura, a Hutu group that has perpetrated massacres of civilians; and a small group called the Union of Congolese Patriots.

Farther away, the Enyele rebels in Equateur are engaged in a decades-old conflict over fishing rights; there is the Mayi Mayi, a localized group with the limited aim of resisting allegedly Rwandan-backed forces in the Congo; and Uganda’s Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) rebels, still active in parts of the Congo, are doing their signature best, killing, raping and abducting children. Indeed, the country’s meltdown has at various times drawn Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Central Africa Republic and Chad into prolonged warfare.

The M23, however, has gotten all the media attention recently. It was started by Ntaganda and other defectors from the Congolese army. Wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes, Ntaganda started cooperating with the Congolese authorities. But the marriage did not last: Ntaganda and others set up M23 less than two years later, claiming that the 23 March 2009 (hence M23) agreement between the government and the Congrès National pour le Défense du Peuple (CNDP), another armed militia, was not being honoured.

It is hard to discern any moment, in a conflict so long and chaotic, with so many false hopes and subsequent disasters, that one can hope may be a turning point. Only a few months ago, hardly anyone in Kinshasa would have had any hope of an end to the long nightmare. Journalists and aid agencies working in conflict situations tend to exaggerate civilian casualties, but the figures bandied about for the Congo’s wars—two to three million fatalities—seem rather an underestimate given the scale of the tragedy.

No one, however, doubts that taking M23 out of the equation will bring great clarity to the situation in the Congo. Or that it will surely indicate that the vast unhappy country may be taking a turn for the better. This is why analysts hope that it will be the intervention brigade’s first target.
Olympic Committee Puts Off Final Decision On Barring Entire Russian Team

toggle caption Francesca Ebel/AP

The International Olympic Committee held an emergency meeting Tuesday but put off a final decision on whether to ban all Russian athletes from the Summer Games that begin in Brazil on Aug. 5.

Though the games are less than three weeks away, the IOC said it would "explore the legal options" and would weigh a collective ban "versus the right to individual justice."

The IOC's Executive Board held the telephone conference Tuesday, one day after the World Anti-Doping Agency issued a report detailing what it said was Russia's state-supported program that enabled its athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs without being detected.

The doping agency said the doping was so systematic and pervasive that it recommended the entire Russian team be banned, a move that would be unprecedented.

"The findings of the report show a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games. Therefore, the IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organization implicated," IOC President Thomas Bach said in a statement.

The IOC has already banned Russia's track and field team.

On Tuesday, the IOC announced additional "provisional measures." They include denying accreditation to any Russian official implicated in the anti-doping report and reviewing the anti-doping tests conducted on all Russian athletes who participated in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.

The IOC did not say when it might rule on Russian athletes scheduled to compete in the Rio Games.

The anti-doping agency's report was a 103-page document from Canadian professor Richard McLaren. He was asked by WADA to look into allegations that Russia's Sports Ministry had for years used a highly orchestrated approach to shield its athletes from international doping monitors.

The McLaren Report confirmed many of those allegations, and as we reported Monday, it also included details about how Russian officials determined which athletes needed help in the form of swapping out tainted urine samples for clean samples, as well as a basic recipe for a concoction nicknamed the "Duchess" — a blend of alcohol and three steroids.
This weekend sees the release of Star Trek Beyond, where Chris Pine’s Captain Kirk has to survive on an alien planet and defeat the villainous Krall, all without the Enterprise. On Monday night, Pine faced a somewhat simpler challenge: beating The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon in a game of Inflatable Flip Cup.

Turns out, Chris Pine is really good at Inflatable Flip Cup. Fallon is a competitor who always puts visible effort into his games, but Pine blew by him, catching an early lead and never letting up. By the time Pine finished (in less than a minute), Fallon was barely halfway through his cups.

A man shows his tooth to an Indian policemen as he seeks permission to see a doctor after he was stopped during a curfew in Srinagar July 19, 2016.

SRINAGAR, India Indian soldiers fired on a stone-throwing crowd defying a curfew in the Kashmir region, killing three people, police said on Tuesday, as unrest sparked by the death of a separatist militant flared.

Authorities have imposed a curfew in Muslim-majority Kashmir for 11 days, blocked mobile phones and briefly ordered curbs on newspapers to stop people from gathering and to control the worst outbreak of violence there in six years.

Late on Monday, protesters blocked a road and threw stones at an army convoy.

"Some miscreants then tried to snatch weapons from the army and tried to set vehicles on fire," a police spokesman said on Tuesday.

The army opened fire after the protesters refused to heed warnings and two women were killed, the spokesman said.

A third person died in hospital on Tuesday, taking the death toll to 42 since protests erupted on July 9 over the killing of Burhan Wani, 22, a commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen militant group, the previous day.

About 3,500 people have been hurt, many with eye injuries caused by pellets Indian forces have been firing from a non-lethal weapon. The injuries have fueled anger.

Kashmir is India's only Muslim-majority state and has been contentious since India and Muslim Pakistan were carved out of British-ruled India and declared independent in 1947.

Both sides rule the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full and India has long accused Pakistan of arming separatists battling Indian forces in its part of Kashmir. Pakistan denies that.

The young militant Wani represented a new generation of fighters in a region where alienation runs deep even though attacks have fallen dramatically since the revolt broke out in 1989.

India's interior minister, Rajnath Singh, said he had ordered security forces to exercise restraint. He told parliament he would visit Kashmir soon and hold talks with people "whose pain is being felt by every Indian".

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which has advocated a tough stand on Kashmir, shares power with a regional party in Kashmir and has been criticized for failing to address grievances.

The publisher of Kashmir's largest-circulation newspaper said authorities had asked him to resume publication after police seized newspapers over the weekend and shut down cable television, saying it was necessary to stop people from fomenting trouble.

But Abdul Rashid Mukhdoomi, printer and publisher of Greater Kashmir, said he was meeting other publishers to decide whether to resume publication under the curfew.

Militants claiming to be "brothers close" to Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent had called on social media for people in Kashmir to attack Indian forces, U.S. intelligence group SITE said on Monday.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The UN has warned that an estimated 70,000 civilians are trapped inside IS-held Manbij

At least 56 civilians have died in US-led coalition air strikes near the Islamic State stronghold of Manbij in north Syria, opposition monitors say.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said residents had been fleeing the village of Tokhar when they were hit.

An opposition activist network said 90 had died in Tokhar and nearby Hoshriya.

There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which has been providing air support for the Kurdish-led offensive to drive IS militants out of Manbij.

On Monday, the Syrian Observatory and another monitoring group, the Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), both said coalition air strikes in the Tokhar area had caused 15 deaths.

The Syrian Observatory said 11 children were among those killed as people fled the village, which is about 14km (9 miles) north of Manbij, at dawn on Tuesday.

The UK-based monitoring group's director, Rami Abdul Rahman, told AFP news agency that the strikes appeared to have been carried out in error, with the civilians mistaken for IS militants.

The LCC said "vacuum missiles" had been fired at Tokhar and Hoshriya, an apparent reference to fuel-air explosive munitions.

The opposition activist network put the death toll in the two areas at 90 and said it included whole families.

An alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters called the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) began an operation to capture Manbij and cut critical supply routes to the IS-held city of Raqqa at the end of May.

Under the cover of US-led coalition air strikes, they succeeded in encircling Manbij within days and entered the town's outskirts in late June.

However, the SDF's advance has been slowed in recent weeks by landmines planted by IS and suicide bomb attacks.

On Friday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein warned that the situation in Manbij, where an estimated 70,000 civilians were trapped, was believed to be deteriorating dramatically.

Mr Zeid said his office had received reports of a number of civilians, including women and children, being killed and injured by air and ground strikes, as well as by landmines.

"Civilians have also reportedly been killed if they leave their homes or attempt to flee," he added.

"Families are unable to access local cemeteries to bury their relatives... and are burying them in their gardens or keeping the corpses in bunkers."

"The town has no electricity or water at present, and no medical facilities are known to be operating," the UN official added. "As the SDF closes in on the city, [IS] has not permitted civilians to leave the area."

New details have emerged regarding the heroic efforts of Orlando police officers during the massacre at the Pulse nightclub last month that left 49 people dead.

One officer recalled how he pulled one shooting victim to safety amid the gunfire, according to documents released Monday and obtained by the Orlando Sentinel.

"He told me he could not stand or walk," the officer wrote, according to the newspaper. "I grabbed both of his wrists, and he grabbed mine. I dragged him outside of the club through the patio, and away from the building."

In the report, officers recount running in and out of the club as shots were being fired by gunman Omar Mateen. Officer Michael Ragsdale wrote that he frantically escorted people out of the club while he was unaware where the gunman was.

"I tried to open the door but I felt something pulling back on it, holding it closed," Officer Ragsdale wrote, according to the paper. "I announced that I was the Orlando Police Department and the door open[ed] freely. Once the door opened victims started running out."

Officer Felix Monroig Santiago wrote that he arrived at the club just after 2 a.m. and "observed multiple casualties on the ground near the bar area and could still hear shots being fired," according to the Sentinel.

Another officer, Russell Sayer, said that many of the people he assisted were "blood soaked." Blood "covered my pants, arms, and boots," he said, the Sentinel reported.

The documents also revealed that Mateen said he was taunted for being a Muslim at his security guard position in the St. Lucie courthouse. He claimed that led him to say he had connections to terrorists, but he later said he made that up. The FBI determined he was not a threat.

Omar Mateen was HIV-negative, user of steroids: autopsy

"I love the United States. The boasting I did it just to satisfy the gang of co-workers who ganged up against me," Mateen wrote in a letter to his bosses, according to the documents. "I'm 1,000 percent pure American. ... I'm against these terrorists anyone of them."

Mateen opened fire during "Latin Night" at the club on June 12 in a rampage that left 49 dead and 53 wounded, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Mateen, who pledged allegiance to ISIS during a call with police dispatchers amid the standoff, was killed after police stormed the club.
