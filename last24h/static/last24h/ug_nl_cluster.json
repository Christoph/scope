The bloody chaos there could all too easily find its way to the continent\u2019s shores<p>Libyans are the first victims of a dysfunctional state that has neither stabilised nor unified since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. But Europe can be affected, too. If Libya doesn\u2019t find a way out of its current state of chaos, two things are likely to happen: refugee and migrant movements will pick up again this summer in large numbers across the central Mediterranean (as an alternative to the Aegean route), and Isis will be able to carve out an even larger foothold for itself, from which it will try to launch attacks across the region and beyond. So it is a good thing that more international attention is now being brought on Libya, whose stabilisation was the topic of an international meeting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/16/world-powers-prepared-arm-un-backed-libyan-government\" title=\"\">held this week in Vienna</a>.

The plan, as it currently stands, is to increase international support for Libya\u2019s new fledgling central government, which last March managed to establish itself in the capital Tripoli. The west hopes this administration will replace rival factions that have vied for power since 2014, creating the vacuum that has helped Isis thrive. Weapon deliveries are being considered to help the unity government defeat the jihadi insurgency, which controls a 250km-long strip of coast around the city of Sirte. However, this initiative is currently being resisted by a rival group based in the east, whose leader is supported by Egypt.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-libya-a-nations-tragedy-a-continents-problem\">Continue reading...</a>", "source": "theguardian.com", "single": 0, "time": "2016-05-18T18:26:26", "keywords": "", "comp": 12, "id": 41, "deg": 3}, {"time_pos": 18.057918922607943, "deg_pos": 205.7142857142857, "title": "Venezuelan protesters clash with security forces \u2013 video", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/18/venezuelan-protesters-clash-with-security-forces-video", "suggest": 0, "images": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a5f5afd456729155fca39ac84c970e4199fe03e/33_0_2889_1733/2889.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=6f879c68a217087c6e2b9bc64cbf99e9", "summary": "<p>Thousands of demonstrators in Venezuela\u2019s capital Caracas clash with security forces during a protest against president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Wednesday.
