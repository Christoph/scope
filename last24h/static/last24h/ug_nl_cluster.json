Mr Cohen himself said \u201c\"I was just reading a review of a movie called <i>Watchmen</i> that uses it and the reviewer said \u2013 'Can we please have a moratorium on \"Hallelujah\" in movies and television shows?'

While critics sometimes poked fun at his somewhat lugubrious vocal style the quality of his material was undeniable. </p>\n\n<p>In his later career he formed a vocal partnership with Jennifer Warnes, who appeared on a number of his albums. </p>\n\n<p>While Mr Cohen became fascinated with Buddhism and was even ordained a Buddhist monk in 1996, he continued to consider himself Jewish: \"I'm not looking for a new religion.\u201d He said \u201cI'm quite happy with the old one, with Judaism.\" </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In a 2009 <i>New York Times</i> article Larry Rohter wrote: \"Mr. Cohen keeps the Sabbath even while on tour and performed for Israeli troops during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
