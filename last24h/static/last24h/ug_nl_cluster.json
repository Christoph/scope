Since last year Middlesex University has received funding from the UK government and the EU to build evidence of the journeys and experiences of refugees fleeing to Greece and Italy. Tragically we see many children on their own and know that many \u201cdisappear\u201d through the system. In January the EU criminal intelligence agency estimated that around 10,000 children had gone missing after arriving in Europe. We suspect the number is even higher.</p><p>These children have been through enough horrific experiences in their lives. The fact that they make a perilous journey, risking their lives, only to find themselves in the hands of criminal gangs should make us all ashamed. Neither Europe nor Turkey is protecting children sufficiently. The argument that taking in children would encourage more to come misses the point. The children we are talking about are already in Europe and need protection.

proposals to accept 3,000 children in a move similar to the kindertransport  by 294 to 276.</p>\n<p>The defeat came after the Home Office persuaded Conservative MPs that it was doing enough to help child refugees in Syria and neighbouring countries. </p>\n<p>Only a handful voted in favour of accepting the child refugees. </p>\n<p>Lord Dubs had called on the government to show the same compassion

1939.</p>\n<p>Edie Friedman, director of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality said she was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d that the amendment had failed to pass.</p>\n<p>She said: \"As a result, children across Europe will remain cold, alone and at risk over the coming months.This was an opportunity to stand on the right side of history, to bring relief to just 3,000 of the 95,000 unaccompanied children who applied for asylum in Europe last year. </p>\n<p>\"We wake up this morning on the wrong side of history and on the wrong side of compassion.\"</p>\n<p>Dr Friedman added: \u201cThe Immigration Bill has shown the UK at its worst, uncaring about the suffering of children a mere 30 miles away in places like Calais, but it has also shown us at our best. </p>\n<p>People of all faiths, from all backgrounds, from across the political spectrum, have come together to speak out for the rights of refugees and asylum seekers and we should be proud that the Jewish community has been so engaged and vocal.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis conversation has not finished. The Immigration Bill is returning today to the House of Lords and we will be consulting with our colleagues in other refugee organisations, as well as Lord Dubs, to find out how the Jewish community can best contribute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Liberal Judaism vice president Rabbi Harry Jacobi, who also came to the UK as a Kindertransport child, likened last night\u2019s result to a similar decision in 1938 to stop Jewish refugees entering Britain.</p>\n<p>He said: \"I am so very saddened and upset. This must have been what Parliament was like in 1938 after the Evian Conference, when refugees were refused admission.</p>\n<p>\"Too many MPs with hardened hearts just like the biblical story of Pharaoh. To close their eyes and hearts to unaccompanied children, to insist that it is alright to detain pregnant women, and that refugees can still be detained indefinitely simply on the say so of an immigration official. These are not the actions of a world-leading moral civilisation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Former Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper MP, was a vocal supporter of the amendment, and referred to Rabbi Jacobi\u2019s journey to Britain in her Commons speech during the debate.</p>\n<p>United Synagouge Rabbi David Mason, of Muswell Hill Synagogue in north London said: \u201cIt\u2019s sad from my perspective the fear of economic impact has mean we are abandoning 1000s of children who are alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely in with what is going on within Europe we want to support the rescue of these children and not get involved in the politics of identity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senior Rabbi to the Movement for Reform Judaism,Laura Janner-Klausner said: \u201cI have met some of the estimated 26,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Europe. </p>\n<p>\"I saw how not knowing their future has a corrosive impact on their mental and physical health.</p>\n<p>\"They lost everything in Syria and are now lost on the continent of Europe. I believe Britain has the capacity and the will to do more during this crisis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Board of Deputies president Jonathan Arkush said: \u201cIt is a Jewish religious imperative to care for those who are alone and vulnerable. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not so long ago that Jewish children fleeing from war and persecution gained refuge in this country on the Kindertransports.  </p>\n<p>\u201cLord Dubs was himself such a child.
